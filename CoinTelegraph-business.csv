Three new crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been put forward for approval by cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments, which also announced a new entity to manage its growing funds.

On May 9, Grayscale said it launched a new arm of its business — the Grayscale Funds Trust — allowing it to manage many of its publicly traded financial products in-house.

In addition to the new trust, Grayscale revealed it filed a registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for three new crypto-focused ETFs, despite previous roadblocks from the regulator over crypto-related ETFs.

The new funds comprise an Ethereum Futures ETF, a Global Bitcoin Composite ETF along with a Privacy ETF.

The Global Bitcoin Composite ETF would invest in exchange-traded products that are related to or backed by Bitcoin (BTC), including Bitcoin mining firms.

Similarly, the Ethereum futures ETF would allow an indirect exposure to the potential future value of Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 by way of shares that track ETH’s price.

The Grayscale Privacy ETF would invest in companies working on blockchain-based privacy technology, the filing explains.

— Grayscale (@Grayscale) May 9, 2023

Until the registration statement relating to Grayscale Funds Trust is approved by the SEC, none of the three ETFs will be available for public purchase.

The announcement comes as Grayscale is still entangled in an ongoing conflict with the SEC over converting its $17 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF product.

On Jan. 13 Grayscale sued the regulator for denying its application, arguing the SEC acted indiscriminately in treating crypto spot traded exchange-traded products differently from futures products.

“There is a 99.9% correlation between prices in the Bitcoin futures market and the spot Bitcoin market,” Grayscale stated in its brief against the SEC.

While the SEC has approved a number of Bitcoin Futures ETFs — which expose buyers to the potential future value of BTC — it has so far rejected every application for a spot Bitcoin investment product, citing concerns about exposing investors to potential fraud and market manipulation.

Crypto mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings announced it has partnered with digital assets infrastructure company Zero Two to create a large-scale immersion Bitcoin-mining facility in Abu Dhabi.

In a May 9 notice, Marathon Digital said the joint venture will be based in Mina Zayed and Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates, comprising two mining sites with a combined 250-megawatt capacity. According to the firm, Marathon and Zero Two plan to power the facilities with excess energy from Abu Dhabi’s grid, claiming it will increase its base load and sustainability.

Crypto mining in the desert climate of Abu Dhabi — where the average annual temperature is roughly 28 degrees Celsius (82 degree Fahrenheit) — was often “infeasible,” according to Marathon Digital. The firm said it had helped develop a “custom-built immersion solution” to cool mining rigs at the proposed facilities, suggesting a liquid-cooling solution.

“For this project, our team successfully co-developed and implemented a full immersion solution, as well as developed proprietary mining software from the ground up to provide flexibility, resilience, and optimization,” said Marathon Digital chair and CEO Fred Thiel.

Ownership of the project, called the Abu Dhabi Global Markets JV Entity, will be split between Zero Two and Marathon Digital, with the two companies controlling 80% and 20%, respectively. The two firms expect both Abu Dhabi facilities to be online by 2024 and produce a combined hash rate of roughly 7 EH/s.

The report of the planned mining operation came amid executives from United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase visiting the UAE to test the potential of the region as a “strategic hub” for its international operations. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong met with policymakers and spoke at the Dubai FinTech Summit.

On May 9, the total market capitalization of BRC-20 Bitcoin tokens surpassed $1 billion, with a total trading volume of $207.7 million in the past 24 hours. Some of the most notable deployed tokens include ORDI, NALS, VMPX, PEPE and MEME, with price variance of between +11% and -55% within the past day.

According to analysts at multichain wallet BitKeep, the BRC-20 token standard is a novel form of fungible token that “employs Ordinals and Inscriptions to create and manage token contracts, token minting, and token transfers, which are stored on the Bitcoin base chain."" Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 0.00000001 Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,778

, enabling its tracking and transfer. Meanwhile, the “inscription” process adds a layer of data to each satoshi, allowing users to create unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The BRC-20 token standard was developed by Twitter user Domo on March 8. Currently, there are over 14,000 BRC-20 tokens deployed on Bitcoin compared to an estimated 400 million tokens on Ethereum. Despite its traction, BitKeep researchers wrote, “BRC-20’s creator has openly stated that the standard is worthless and that users should not waste money mass minting this fun experiment.""

On May 8, BitKeep announced that it would soon support the ordinals protocol and BRC-20 protocol on its mobile and plugin-extension platforms. A new Bitcoin NFT section will also be included in the BitKeep NFT marketplace, allowing for the display, minting, transfer and trading of BTC NFTs based on the ordinal protocol. Developers wrote:

“BitKeep will continue to monitor new protocols, such as BRC-21, and provide more diverse support and services based on market trends and user demands.""

Despite being enthusiastic about its outlook, Trust Wallet does not support Bitcoin ordinals. Meanwhile, MetaMask added a new feature allowing users to store ordinals in February. Cryptocurrency hardware wallet provider Ledger also supports the ordinals protocol.

On May 9, crypto exchange OKX sent approximately $60 million worth of digital assets to wallets connected to failed hedge fund Alameda Research, according to data from crypto analytics platform Arkham Intelligence.

The funds were spread out among 16 separate transactions and included approximately 337.9 million Mask Network (MASK) tokens (worth $1.3 million), as well as $57.77 million worth of the Tether 

USDT

$1.00

 stablecoin.

According to Arkham Intelligence, Alameda Research currently holds over $284 million worth of assets in its crypto wallets. Its largest holdings are USDT, BitDAO (BIT), Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 and Stargate Finance (STG).

The funds may have been part of a recovery effort to pay back customers of Alameda’s sister company, FTX. On March 30, OKX said it planned to return approximately $157 million it held on behalf of FTX and Alameda. The crypto exchange said it had frozen the funds in November to safeguard them. According to that same announcement, FTX filed a motion on March 30 to force OKX to release the funds to pay back creditors, which OKX said it “welcomed.”

After declaring bankruptcy and coming under new management, FTX and Alameda have been aggressively trying to recover funds from firms they previously sent crypto to. On March 23, FTX reached a settlement with hedge fund Modulo Capital, allowing it to recover $460 million previously invested in the fund. On May 4, FTX filed a motion to claw back $4 billion it allegedly lent to bankrupt crypto lending firm Genesis Global.

FTX Group and roughly 130 companies under its umbrella, including Alameda Research, filed for bankruptcy in November after the crypto exchange suffered a liquidity crisis. Alameda Research’s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, has been charged with fraud for allegedly colluding with former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried to misappropriate FTX customer funds. She pleaded guilty to the charges on Dec. 22. However, Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty and has sought to dismiss some of the charges against him.

According to a May 8 post by Miller Thomson, the law firm representing users of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX, interim distribution of funds tied to bankruptcy proceedings will be scheduled “in the coming weeks.""

Bankruptcy trustee Ernst & Young announced the interim distribution in consultation with estate inspectors. In the near future, the trustee will post a Notice to Affected Users regarding details about the manner and procedure of the distribution. According to Miller Thomson, a small number of affected users are expected to receive a Notice of Disallowance of Claim, which means that the creditor’s claim has been revised or disallowed in the bankruptcy process. 

“If you received a Notice of Disallowance, you have the right to appeal the decision,"" Miller Thomson explained, adding: 

“The first step is to review the reasons for the revision or disallowance and gather any necessary evidence to support their claim. In this case, the Trustee is most likely to have issued a Notice of Disallowance if there was a discrepancy in your proof of claim.""

QuadrigaCX, once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, became insolvent in February 2019, shortly after its co-founder, Gerald Cotten, died in India, taking the private keys to QuadrigaCX’s offline storage systems to his grave. According to the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), QuadrigaCX owes its affected clients an estimated $160 million. In addition to losing access to cold storage, the OSC alleges that Cotten realized $86 million in crypto trading losses on the QuadrigaCX platform, which was then covered with users’ funds. 

Since then, bankruptcy trustee Ernst & Young has recovered $34.3 million worth of assets. “We did not identify any other assets beyond those identified by Ernst & Young,"" wrote the OSC.

Financial technology company PayPal recently disclosed its cryptocurrency holdings in a quarterly report filed to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

Claiming a combined total of $943 million in cryptocurrency assets as of March 31, 2023, the filing shows a 56% increase over the company’s previous quarter where PayPal disclosed $604 million.

PayPal’s reported total financial liabilities for this quarter were $1.2 billion, with crypto assets making up 77.9% — up more than 10% from 2022’s reported fourth quarter liabilities.

According to the report, PayPal considers its crypto assets a “safeguarding liability” due to the “unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies.” The disclosure also indicates that the specific cryptocurrencies held by the company remain unchanged since last quarter:

“We allow our customers in certain markets to buy, hold, sell, receive, and send certain cryptocurrencies as well as use the proceeds from sales of cryptocurrencies to pay for purchases at checkout. These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin (collectively, ‘our customers’ crypto assets’).”

Custody of the assets PayPal holds on behalf of its customers remains limited to third-party holding companies. PayPal recognizes that this presents a liability for customers in the event that third parties are unable to process transactions — a statement carried over from last quarter’s filing — however, the filing also indicates that no such fault has yet occurred:

“As of March 31, 2023, the Company has not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and therefore, the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset were recorded at the same value.”

The Q1 2023 cryptocurrency asset breakdown for PayPal includes $499 million in Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,778

 (up from December’s $291 million), $362 million in Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 (up from $250 million), and $82 million composed of Bitcoin Cash 

BCH

$121

 and Litecoin 

LTC

$80.15

 (up from $63 million).

Screenshot of PayPal’s quarterly financial disclosure.

PayPal’s profitability also increased in the first quarter. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company disclosed per-share earnings of $0.70, up from $0.43 in the first quarter of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, PayPal’s per-share earnings were $1.17, up from $0.88 in the first quarter of 2022.

The highest intraday price of Bitcoin on Binance.US amounted to as much as $28,600, while the intraday high for its market price only equaled $28,004. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s lowest intraday values ranged from $27,350 to $27,669 on Binance.US.

Binance.US’ Bitcoin premium comes shortly after Binance, the main global exchange, suffered major withdrawal issues on May 7.

The exchange was forced to close withdrawals amid Bitcoin facing unusual mempool congestion, with more than 400,000 transactions getting stuck on the Bitcoin blockchain. The event apparently triggered Binance to finally consider the addition of the Lightning Network on its platform, which is designed to speed up BTC transactions and make them less expensive.

A new blockchain network aimed at financial institutions is in the works from a conglomerate of participants in the finance and tech space, including the likes of Microsoft and Goldman Sachs.

According to the announcement on May 9, the Canton Network will be a privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network aimed at those working with institutional assets. It will allow the synchronization of financial markets that were “previously siloed.”

The network will begin testing its capabilities in July, which include extensive privacy controls and the ability to achieve the scale and performance needed by major financial institutions. Participants in the network currently include BNP Paribas, Cboe Global Markets, Digital Asset, Paxos, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Deloitte and others.

Cathy Clay, executive vice president of Cboe Global Markets — one of the partners in the project — said that, when leveraged, blockchain technology can potentially “unlock” new opportunities in the market.

“The tokenization of real-world assets may offer an unprecedented opportunity to create new market infrastructure and drive efficiency in the trading of products across the globe.”

Canton is built on Daml, the smart contract language of Digital Asset, which creates an interoperable system where “assets, data, and cash” can synchronize across linked applications.

In March, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment bought up around $18 million in Coinbase shares, which equaled about 269,928 shares. A study from Goldman Sachs released on May 8 revealed that 32% of family offices currently have investments in digital assets.

On May 3, the securities token platform INX launched a new MPC wallet for institutional investors to control assets and employee access to such assets.

As the burgeoning blockchain technology paradigm has continued to evolve, a whole host of unique asset classes have started to make their way into the mainstream. Private equity tokens are one such offering, serving as digital representations of ownership in private equity investments powered by a decentralized ledger. 

These tokens enable fractional ownership, improved liquidity and simplified management of private equity assets. They are created through a process called tokenization, which involves converting real-world assets into digital tokens that can be bought, sold or traded on various platforms.

Recent research indicates that private equity and hedge fund assets are the most likely to see tokenization in the near future. The study surveyed fund managers in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, collectively responsible for around $546.5 billion in assets under management, and found that 73% of the participants identified private equity assets as the most likely first to see significant tokenization.

Moreover, the World Economic Forum has estimated that up to 10% of global GDP could be stored and transacted via distributed ledger technology by 2027, with crypto-asset custodian Finoa reporting that tokenized markets may be worth as much as $24 trillion by the same year.

As a result, most fund managers (93%) overwhelmingly believe that alternative asset classes — such as private equity — are highly likely to be targeted for tokenization due to their inherent lack of liquidity, transparency and accessibility compared with traditional asset classes.

The financial proposition of private equity tokens

One of the most enticing aspects of private equity tokens is the potential for enhanced liquidity.

Traditionally, private equity investments have been plagued by long lock-up periods and limited exit opportunities, making them unappealing for some investors. However, by tokenizing these assets and enabling them to trade on secondary markets, private equity tokens can offer a much more liquid alternative.

This new level of liquidity not only allows investors to enter and exit positions more easily but also helps unlock the value of illiquid assets, making them more attractive to a broader range of investors.

In addition to improved liquidity, private equity tokens also offer increased transparency in an industry that has historically been opaque. The use of blockchain technology, which underpins these tokens, allows for the public tracking of ownership and transactions, providing investors with a real-time, transparent view of the underlying assets. This level of transparency can help build trust and confidence in the private equity space and reduce the risks associated with fraud and mismanagement.

Furthermore, these tokens democratize access to the private equity market, breaking down barriers to entry for retail investors. By allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership in private companies or funds, they create opportunities for smaller investments, thus enabling a wider range of individuals to participate in the growth of private companies. This democratization of access not only diversifies investment portfolios but also fosters innovation and economic growth as more capital is funneled into the private sector.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Nikolay Denisenko, co-founder of Swiss neo-digital bank Brighty and former lead backend engineer for Revolut, noted the aforementioned benefits of tokenization for private equity. However, he said that “there are factors that could potentially limit the growth and adoption of private equity tokens. One key factor is the regulatory environment, which is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Ensuring compliance with securities laws and Anti-Money Laundering regulations can be a challenge.”

Recent developments surrounding the space

While venture capitalists have eagerly financed blockchain technology to revolutionize the banking sector, they have been more hesitant to adopt it for their own operations. However, recent initiatives to tokenize private funds seem to signal a significant shift in this mindset.

For example, Pierre Mauriès — who previously served as the private equity technology practice director at PwC and a mergers and acquisitions strategy executive for The Carlyle Group — recently founded Nemesis Technologies. The company is tokenizing a $500 million fund that will become available on Securitize, a digital security issuance and compliance platform. The process will transform the fund stakes into digital tokens, allowing investors in the United States and Japan to trade them on Securitize’s brokerage platform, Securitize Markets.

In a recent interview, Mauriès emphasized the importance of tokenization for the future of alternative investments, highlighting several benefits for limited partnerships. For instance, Nemesis fund investors can trade tokens after four years, offering earlier liquidity than traditional models. Additionally, the digital nature of the tokens simplifies fractionalization and sale to other investors compared with the conventional secondary market.

Other prominent firms like KKR, Apollo, Hamilton Lane, Backed and Partners Group are also spearheading jumping into the private equity tokenization movement. Backed, in particular, recently introduced its ERC-1400 security standard-based private equity token, BACD. 

The firm claims that the token’s features include faster settlement speeds, automated compliance through smart contracts, 24/7 trading and better transparency. BACD tokens represent private equity ownership and function as utility tokens for exchange and payments.

Lastly, private equity’s early adoption of tokenization seems primarily driven by the desire to expand investor bases, as tokens provide retail investors with easier access to private equity. By offering digital tokens, PE firms can potentially engage with 13.6 million accredited investors managing $75 trillion in the United States alone, according to Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo.

Potential drawbacks

As the legal and regulatory frameworks surrounding tokenized assets continue to evolve, looming uncertainty can make it difficult for private equity firms and investors to navigate the tokenization process and adhere to local and international regulations.

Furthermore, the market for trading tokenized private equity assets is still relatively nascent, which can result in limited trading volumes and reduced liquidity for these tokens when compared with more established, liquid asset classes.

Technological security, such as the stability of the underlying blockchain technology, is crucial for successfully implementing tokenized private equity. Blockchain networks can be vulnerable to hacks, system failures or other technical risks, which could compromise the integrity and value of the tokenized assets.

Moreover, widespread market adoption is necessary for tokenized private equity to reach its full potential, but this requires significant buy-in from private equity firms, investors and other stakeholders, which may be challenging due to traditional industry practices and resistance to change.

Tokenized private equity assets may also face skepticism from potential investors who associate blockchain technology and tokenization with the volatility and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,778

. Overcoming this reputation risk may require extensive education and marketing efforts.

Tokenizing private equity can also introduce extra complexity, particularly for investors unfamiliar with digital assets, blockchain technology or the process of trading and managing tokenized assets.

Lastly, while blockchain technology can offer enhanced security, storing and managing digital assets requires stringent security measures to protect against hacking, phishing and other cyber threats, which can introduce new risks and challenges for private equity firms and investors.

In the view of Brighty’s Denisenko, these tokens can majorly impact liquidity and market volatility. While increased liquidity may benefit some investors, it could also lead to higher volatility in the market.

This may affect both retail and institutional investors, who may not be prepared for sudden price fluctuations. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to establish robust secondary markets with appropriate risk management mechanisms and to educate investors about the potential risks and rewards associated with private equity tokens.

“The problem is that having an uncontrolled secondary market is not the best-case scenario for the company because it makes it hard to reduce volatility. Hence, total decentralisation is not a workable option, only through oracles and the DAO’s approval,” Denisenko concluded.

Recent: AI’s black box problem: Challenges and solutions for a transparent future

Despite these drawbacks, the potential benefits of tokenizing private equity are significant. As the technology and regulatory landscape continue to evolve, these challenges may be mitigated or addressed entirely.

Looking ahead

While the core concept pervading tokenization may not necessarily provide investors with a significantly expanded pool of potential market participants, the primary attraction surrounding tokenized private equity lies in the simplified experience it offers smaller investors with limited means.

Moreover, as tokenization gains traction in the private equity domain, more established financial entities will likely adopt this innovative approach. With the support of industry leaders such as KKR, Apollo, Hamilton Lane and Partners Group, the tokenization movement is well-positioned to reshape how private equity investments are managed and traded. Thus, it will be interesting to see how this relatively nascent market niche continues to mature moving forward.

The recent surge in Bitcoin

 transaction fees has lit a fire under one of the largest crypto exchanges to upgrade to the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Following a second halt in withdrawals, Binance announced it would work on “enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.”

The Lightning Network (LN) is a federated system for cheap, near-instant payments built atop Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin mempool (where transactions waiting to be confirmed gather) is full or busy, the Lightning Network is unaffected.

Several large crypto exchanges have integrated the Lightning Network, including Bitfinex, River Financial, OKX, Kraken and CoinCorner. If implemented correctly, the Lightning Network would allow users to withdraw and send Bitcoin immediately from wallets, sidestepping the congested Bitcoin blockchain.

The largest crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase, is also warming up to the LN. Further to comments that CEO Brian Armstrong would integrate the LN soon, Armstrong finally sent Cointelegraph reporter Joe Hall $100 over the Lightning Network, demonstrating that he is familiar with the layer-2 payments protocol.

European Bitcoin exchanges are also embracing the LN. Adem Bilican, the chief technology officer of Swiss-based Bitcoin exchange, Relai, told Cointelegraph:

“We believe that Bitcoin is the best savings technology ever invented. But you should be able to spend and send BTC as fast and cheaply as possible. The Lightning Network is the best solution to tackle that, no matter how the on-chain transaction fees look.”

Swiss Bitcoin exchange Pocket Bitcoin recently tweeted it would “get this Lightning thing started” in response to higher and higher fees on the Bitcoin base chain.

However, given that the LN is a relatively new solution in the crypto space, payment failure can occur. The network is growing and scaling organically, but more liquidity may help the network scale faster. Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Bitfinex, shed light on the situation: 

“The Bitfinex node is the most interconnected node on the entire Lightning Network. It is also the biggest, providing liquidity to most of the other nodes. Hence the chances of failure are extremely low.“

True to form, Ardoino tweeted in response to the high fees that users should ask their crypto exchange to integrate LN. Binance and Coinbase are hopping on board, with other large exchanges Gemini, KuCoin and Bybit yet to announce implementing the LN.

The battle between the music industry and artificial intelligence continues, with reports claiming that Spotify is taking down AI-generated music.

A Financial Times report revealed that the music streaming platform has removed 7% of all songs created by AI music startup Boomy, amounting to “tens of thousands” of songs.

Spotify is also said to be ramping up its policing of the platform in light of the situation.

This comes after Spotify and other streaming services began receiving complaints of fraud and clutter on the platform. Music industry giant Universal Music Group (UMG) alerted streaming service providers of “suspicious streaming activity” on Boomy tracks, according to FT sources.

Ultimately, the songs were removed due to the suspected “artificial streaming” of bots posing as listeners, Spotify commented, saying:

“Artificial streaming is a longstanding, industry-wide issue that Spotify is working to stamp out across our service.”

Representatives from Boomy said the platform is “categorically against” all manipulation or artificial streaming of any kind.

Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group, commented to investors:

“The recent explosive development in generative AI will, if left unchecked, both increase the flood of unwanted content on platforms and create rights issues with respect to existing copyright law.”

Last month, UMG emailed streaming services, including Spotify, to request they block AI services from accessing music catalogs for training purposes. UMG has also sent requests “left and right” to remove AI-generated songs from platforms.

While music industry giants are fighting to control AI, other artists such as Grimes are championing the technology. The musician permitted creators to use her voice and be a “guinea pig” for AI music creation as long as a small set of rules were followed and royalties were split.

 mining firm Core Scientific has objected to paying a $4.7 million administrative claim put forward by crypto lender Celsius Network, leading to a battle between the firms over contractual obligations.

According to the objection filed in Texas bankruptcy court on May 5, Core Scientific has asked that Celsius Network’s $4.7 million administrative claims be rejected as the firm cannot prove it is entitled to one.

“Celsius’ request for allowance and immediate payment of the Celsius alleged admin claim ignores that Core has substantial claims against Celsius, which Core believes exceed the Celsius alleged admin claim,” wrote the objection.

For context, Core first signed a contract with Celsius in 2020 to host its cryptocurrency holdings in Core’s data centers. However, due to an increase in the price of power, Core passed these additional costs on to Celsius, an allowance that was reportedly stipulated in the original contract.

Despite Celsius initially paying these costs, the crypto lender ceased payments after it filed bankruptcy, Core Scientific claimed in the objection.

“If anyone has been unjustly enriched here, it is Celsius,” Core Scientific wrote in the objection. According to the now-defunct Bitcoin miner, Celsius has been “sitting on almost $8 million of money it owes to Core” due to a “blatant post-petition violation” of the agreed-upon dispute resolution mechanism.

Celsius now owes Core Scientific a total of approximately $11 million, a sum that accrues an additional $28,000 in fees and interest with each passing day, the Bitcoin mining firm’s lawyers argued.

The conflict between the two firms has been raging since Oct. 19, when Core Scientific first accused Celsius of failing to pay its power bills, citing the non-payments as a significant factor in the liquidity issues that led to the embattled Bitcoin miner filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Dec. 21.

“The millions of dollars Celsius shortchanged Core after Celsius’s bankruptcy filing plus the millions of dollars in litigation…significantly contributed to Core’s liquidity drain and eventual chapter 11 filing.”

On Dec. 28, Core Scientific filed a motion seeking approval to reject Celsius’ contracts, claiming the firm’s failure to pay its power bills constituted a material breach of contract. On Jan. 3, Celsius agreed to let Core Scientific shut down more than 37,000 Bitcoin mining rigs that the miner was hosting for the crypto lender.

Public opinion of banks appears to be dwindling according to an April survey, as the industry struggles to contain the collapse of several high-profile financial institutions in recent months.

A Gallup poll conducted across the United States in April with at least a thousand respondents revealed that 48% of them said that they were concerned about their money in the bank, with almost 20% who indicated they were “very concerned.”

Concern over banking safety question: Gallup

It should be noted however that the poll was conducted after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but before First Republic Bank failed in late April.

Gallup concluded that the level of worry was on a par with that measured during the last bank-induced financial crisis in 2008 “when financial institutions previously believed to be “too big to fail” collapsed.”

“The latest readings are similar to those in 2008. In September of that year, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which remains the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.”
Hundreds of American banks at risk

Meanwhile, experts at the Hoover Institution think tank postulate that if half of all uninsured savers withdrew all of their cash, 186 American banks would be at “potential risk of impairment.”

These banks have total assets of $300 billion but represent less than 5% of the estimated 4,135 FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insured commercial banks in the United States.

Furthermore, according to reports, California-based PacWest, Arizona’s Western Alliance, and Memphis-based First Horizon hang in the balance following a share price slump last week.

Related: Banking crisis: What does it mean for crypto?

A more damning report emerged from the UK’s Telegraph earlier this month, suggesting that half of the banks in America could be insolvent.

It cited research published in April by Stanford University banking expert Amit Seru, who estimated that more than 2,315 U.S. banks are currently sitting on assets worth less than their liabilities.

“The U.S. banking system’s market value of assets is $2.2 trillion lower than suggested by their book value of assets accounting for loan portfolios held to maturity,” he said.

Cryptocurrency trading platform Bittrex has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware.

Claim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!

In a May 8 filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Bittrex estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors, between $500 million and $1 billion in assets, and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities as part of bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy covered its Seattle-based entity Bittrex, Inc, two Bittrex entities in Malta and an affiliated entity Desolation Holdings LLC.

Bittrex Global GmbH, the Liechtenstein-based global entity for exchange, was not included in the filing. In a statement to Cointelegraph, Bittrex Global CEO Oliver Linch said Bittrex's bankruptcy proceedings ""[drew] a line under the U.S. wind-down from a legal perspective.""

""[Some customers'] funds remain – safe and secure – on the platform,"" said Linch. ""By initiating Chapter 11 proceedings, Bittrex U.S. is able to hand those over to the court, and the court is then responsible for returning them to customers [...] This is simply an exercise in Bittrex completing the wind-down of operations in the U.S. as previously announced, and using the legal process of Chapter 11 to tie up loose ends.""

The declaration followed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charging the company and its co-founder and former CEO William Shihara for securities violations in April. The regulator claimed Bittrex, Inc and Bittrex Global operated an unregistered securities exchange. In October, the exchange also received charges pertaining to Bank Secrecy Act violations from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and agreed to pay around $29 million in a settlement.

OFAC is the largest creditor listed on Bittrex's bankruptcy filing, with the exchange booking a $24.2-million claim for the Office. Its next largest creditor is a crypto wallet with a $14.5 million claim. FinCEN is also listed as a top 50 creditor with a claim of $3.5 million, the SEC is listed with an undetermined amount of claims.

The SEC's enforcement actions and its recent bankruptcy filing comes as Bittrex announced in March that it would wind down its U.S. operations by April 30, citing ""continued regulatory uncertainty"" in the country.

It has been a hard year for Bittrex's entity in the U.S. in 2023. The exchange also cut 83 employees in February citing the crypto market downtown caused by the collapses and bankruptcies of other crypto firms.

Bittrex's bankruptcy is the latest in a line of other crypto exchange or lending platforms that have also recently filed for Chapter 11 protection, including FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager Digital.

MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that operates on the Ethereum blockchain and issues stablecoin DAI, has announced that it has launched the Spark Protocol, a lending solution for DAI users.

According to the Twitter announcement, the first version of the Spark Protocol will act as a “lending marketplace,” providing users with supply and borrowing features for cryptocurrencies such as Ether 

ETH

$1,853

, staked Ether (stETH), DAI 

DAI

$1.00

, and staked DAI (sDAI). The platform is specifically designed for DAI and aims to provide users with access to competitive interest rates.

The Spark Protocol is also linked to Maker’s D3M (Direct Deposit Dai Module), a system that enables interaction between the Maker ecosystem and third-party lending pools. The link between Spark Protocol and Maker’s D3M seeks to enable users to borrow DAI at more competitive rates, with an initial annual rate of just 1.11%. 

Regarding the connection between Spark Protocol and Maker’s D3M, the announcement noted: “This direct wholesale credit line in DAI injects and automatically balances fresh DAI liquidity into Spark Lend and enables its users to access the best rates in the market.” 

Ultimately, the Spark Protocol lending solution promises to enhance MakerDAO’s DAI lending capabilities, increase liquidity, offer users improved rates, offer a yield-bearing version of DAI and provide more liquidity options.

MakerDAO recently proposed a new “constitution” designed to establish and formalize its governance processes, as well as safeguard against potential threats from malicious actors who may attempt to take over the protocol. 

To ensure the security and stability of the Maker Protocol and protect user funds from potential failures or losses due to human and institutional decisions, MakerDAO’s new constitution utilizes “alignment engineering” to solidify the core commitments of the Maker community.

Peer-to-peer crypto marketplace Paxful has announced it is back online after suspending operations in April.

In an update posted to its website, Paxful said its team had relaunched the marketplace after more than 30 days. Though the platform said its wallet had “remained fully operational” during the suspended service, it’s unclear how Paxful intends to move forward.

“Over the last month, our team has worked diligently to get the marketplace back online with the safety and security of users paramount,” said Paxful.

Court records from March showed that Paxful CEO Ray Youssef and co-founder Artur Schaback lobbed allegations at each other over misappropriation of company funds, money laundering and evasion of United States sanctions against Russia, before the suspension of the marketplace’s operations. Youssef later said in a blog post there would be “key staff departures” and blamed the U.S. regulatory environment as his reasons for the shutdown.

The platform has been largely silent on social media since the announcement, with Youssef saying in April he had made his “final act” as CEO in unfreezing 88% of certain users’ accounts — though he was still listed as CEO on the company's website at the time of publication. Cointelegraph reached out to Paxful but did not receive an immediate response.

A state-subsidized Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company recently announced the launch of “Spark Model,” an AI system designed to compete directly with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The launch by the company, iFlytek, took place at a tech event in Hefei called “Spark Desk” and featured a full demonstration of the new system’s capabilities.

Per a translation provided by Bing, iFlytek founder and president Liu Qingfeng told event attendees that the Spark Model — also referred to as the “cognitive big model” — represented the “dawn of general artificial intelligence.”

While there’s no scientific consensus on whether general artificial intelligence (also referred to as artificial general intelligence, or AGI) is even possible using current machine learning techniques, the billionaire tech mogul did offer a comparison to ChatGPT and a timeline for updates:

“This year, we will continue to upgrade the big model, and on October 10, we will surpass ChatGPT in the Chinese [language] and reach the same level as it in English.”

Details about the underlying technology powering Spark Model are scarce as of the time of this article’s publishing, but Qingfeng described the AI’s capabilities as “far ahead of the existing system that can be measured in China.”

Direct comparisons between ChatGPT and similar models can be difficult to make without side-by-side benchmarking. Not only does OpenAI keep training details and other proprietary information under wraps, but ChatGPT is also banned in China — a fact that limits OpenAI’s ability to train its models on Chinese languages and culture.

The current ban on ChatGPT in China has been described as potentially stifling, especially when compared to Hong Kong — a city designated as a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China — where there’s no populace-wide ban on the use of technologies such as ChatGPT and cryptocurrency.

In Hong Kong and throughout the West, ChatGPT has become increasingly popular among cryptocurrency users and companies for its ability to generate code and as an underlying technology for the development of advanced trading bots and portfolio analysis. 

If the proposed upgrades to the Spark Model do manage to give iFlytek a leg up on OpenAI and ChatGPT, it would represent not only a monumental moment in tech (ChatGPT is widely considered among the most powerful of today’s generative AI systems) but it will also have done so in a relatively short amount of time.

According to Qingfeng, the company’s research arm began work on Spark Model just six months ago, on Dec. 22, 2022. By way of comparison, OpenAI began developing the precursor to its GPT products in 2015. ChatGPT wasn’t launched until Nov. 30, 2022.

Following United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase announcing the launch of its global derivatives platform, key executives at the firm are meeting with industry leaders and policymakers in the United Arab Emirates.

In a May 7 blog post, Coinbase said CEO Brian Armstrong and some of the firm’s executive team planned to discuss the potential for the UAE “to be a strategic hub” for the crypto exchange. According to the company, it was working with regulators in the Abu Dhabi Global Market and Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority as part of efforts to potentially expand into the region.

“[The UAE is] exciting for us as a potential hub to build as well, an international hub for Coinbase that could serve not only in the Middle East but parts of Africa or other countries in Asia,” said Armstrong at the Dubai Fintech Summit on May 8. “I think the U.S. right now is a little bit behind in terms of regulatory clarity and some of the rhetoric from the top.”

On May 2, Coinbase announced the launch of the Coinbase International Exchange, a platform offering crypto derivatives trading. The launch came amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission potentially charging Coinbase with securities violations following the issuance of a Wells notice in March. Though Armstrong has sometimes been critical of regulatory clarity affecting digital assets in the U.S., he told shareholders in a Q1 earnings call that he had no intention of moving operations outside the country.

“The region is standing-out as a leader in the development of a web3 ecosystem, making it an attractive location to consider investing in,” said the Coinbase blog, referring to the UAE. “The vacuum created by other notable jurisdictions means that international counterparts, such as the UAE, are racing to fill the regulatory gap.”

Before its Wells notice, Coinbase officials, including Armstrong, had met with U.S. policymakers to discuss crypto regulations in the country. Chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the firm had meetings with SEC representatives “more than 30 times over nine months” as of March but largely did not receive feedback on its proposals.

The UAE has steadily opened up opportunities for crypto firms, seemingly to draw in capital and jobs. Dubai established a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and set up the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in March 2022, taking advantage of the Emirates’ free-trade zones with separate rules and regulations.

Artificial intelligence has been growing at an unprecedented rate in recent years and is being integrated into a range of industries. But its rapid growth has sparked concern over job losses, as many tasks previously performed by humans could soon be automated by AI.

For example, on May 1, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg that 7,800 jobs at the firm could be replaced by AI and automation over the next five years, representing approximately 30% of its workforce.

While AI has the potential to improve efficiency, increase productivity and reduce costs, the rapid advancements seen in tools such as ChatGPT-4 — which represents a huge improvement on its predecessor, ChatGPT-3.5 — have many people concerned that their industry will be one of those hit hardest by related job losses.

ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) can already be used to complete a variety of tasks, such as generating smart contract code, handling community management, performing market analysis and more. 

A research report from professional services firm Accenture released in March refers to the growing popularity of ChatGPT as “AI’s first true inflection point in public adoption,” adding:

“Nearly every job will be impacted — some will be eliminated, most will be transformed, and many new jobs will be created.”

Accenture’s research found that 40% of working hours across various industries could be affected by LLMs and identified banking as the industry most likely to be affected, as 54% of tasks were found to have a high potential for automation, closely followed by insurance at 48%.

Replacement and synthesis

Cointelegraph asked Gary Marcus, an AI entrepreneur and co-author of the book Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust, what he thought about AI’s impact on various industries.

Marcus suggested that commercial artists may be most at risk. “Commercial art” refers to branding, logos, advertising and graphic design — generally, art used for commercial purposes. 

Commercial art is distinct from fine art, which refers to paintings, sculpture and photography — art that is more likely to be displayed at art museums such as the Louvre and is much harder for AI to create.

Marcus downplayed the prospect of job losses in the short term, however, noting that “in many cases, people will work together with machines, at least for [the] next several years.”

When asked how people can best future-proof their jobs to avoid being replaced by AI, Marcus replied: “It’s hard to know for sure, but I think that creative problem-solving skills and good critical thinking will remain valuable for a long time.”

The prospect of job losses due to AI is also something the World Economic Forum has been closely monitoring. It released its “Future of Jobs Report 2023” on April 30, which predicts that clerical or secretarial roles such as bank tellers and data entry clerks would be hit the hardest.

Echoing Marcus, the report indicates that higher-level skills such as analytical and creative thinking would be most in demand over the course of the next five years, and notes that the number-one training strategy for companies with more than 50,000 employees is to train their employees to efficiently use AI tools.

Job creation from AI

While the WEF report highlights that AI will likely replace many jobs, it notes that it will also create jobs and is merely contributing to an overall trend toward automation.

Accenture makes similar claims in its report, highlighting that many of the “language tasks” that could be automated by LLMs could be “transformed into more productive activity through augmentation and automation.”

A working paper released on March 27 by ChatGPT creator OpenAI and researchers from the University of Pennsylvania suggests that more hands-on professions such as cooks, mechanics and stonemasons were highly unlikely to be replaced by AI tools in the near future.

The paper also predicts that jobs that involved data or information processing, as well as those in the healthcare industry, are at much greater risk of automation, as programming and writing skills are more in line with the capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT.

AI Eye: ‘Biggest ever’ leap in AI, cool new tools, AIs are the real DAOs

While the healthcare industry will still require many people for the more hands-on roles like nurses and surgeons, providers are increasingly using AI to analyze patient data, so many healthcare workers who are involved in data analysis could have their roles automated.

In all, there seems to be a consensus that clerical and other administrative roles will be the most heavily affected jobs over the next few years, and workers who are able to hone their creative/analytical thinking skills and become adept at using AI tools to boost their productivity will give themselves the best possible chance to not be replaced.

The Australian blockchain company Everledger has reportedly entered insolvency proceedings after failing to raise new funding from an undisclosed investor.

Everledger, which uses blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other goods, failed to make its latest funding round happen, the AFR reported on May 8.

Subsequently, Everledger was quietly placed into voluntary administration as the firm could not pay its debts. All Everledger employees were given layoff notices on March 31, with Vincents Chartered Accountants being appointed as administrators on April 24. The first meeting of creditors was scheduled for May 8.

According to Everledger founder Leanne Kemp, the company’s management was forced to take this decision to protect the interests of shareholders.

“The second tranche of funding due to Everledger did not materialize, and subsequently, we understand that there are external reasons and pressures on this investor, which has meant Everledger was placed in a difficult and unexpected position,” Kemp said.

One of the critically important decisions was an immediate redundancy of employees and to hold the firm in control of administrators while its affairs were finalized, the founder added.

Kemp went on to say that Everledger planned its latest investment around the last external funding round required before profitability. “I would not suggest Everledger was a ‘cash burning’ startup,” she stated, adding:

“Certainly, our use of capital and operational footprint was in total alignment with the board’s direction under a controlled growth plan. This is not a company that scaled too fast or took on venture capital and burnt it in 18 months.”

Everledger did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

The company’s insolvency proceedings come despite Everledger being backed by major investors, including the Australian government and the Chinese internet giant Tencent.

In 2019, Tencent led Everledger’s Series A round with a $20 million investment. According to the AFR, Everledger also secured $3.5 million from the United Kingdom Government’s Future Fund in 2021. Over the past eight years, Everledger has reportedly raised $51.7 million in external investment.

Founded in 2015, Everledger is one of the world’s major companies pioneering blockchain-based platforms for tracking supply chains. Some companies, including the Danish logistics firm Maersk and the United States technology company IBM, have terminated their blockchain supply chain tracking products, citing a lack of “global industry collaboration.”

Despite major industry closures, the concept of blockchain-based supply chain platforms is still thriving in some parts of the world. Hong Kong-based Global Shipping Business Network continues building blockchain-based supply chain products and is bullish on blockchain as a crucial logistics tool in the long term.

Ripple has spent $200 million defending the case brought against it by the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. 

Garlinghouse dropped the figure during a fireside chat at the Dubai Fintech Summit on May 8. He stated that the U.S. is stuck compared with the regulatory progress of the United Arab Emirates virtual asset regulatory authority and the recent Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) bill in the European Union. He went on to share that by the time the case is decided, Ripple will have spent $200 million defending itself against a lawsuit which, from its very beginning, doesn’t make a lot of sense.

In a message to SEC chair Gary Gensler, Garlinghouse expressed regret about the U.S. falling behind significantly as Ripple expands to the United Arab Emirates. According to him, the tough thing about the situation is having a country that has put politics ahead of policy. Garlinghouse said one of the first pieces of advice he gives entrepreneurs when they ask him about getting something started is,” If I were you, I would not start in the United States.” He believes many U.S.-based companies and U.S. public companies would agree.

When asked about the U.S. needing a clear regulatory framework for crypto, Garlinghouse said the SEC must understand that the vast majority of people working in crypto and blockchain are good actors who want to stay within the rules of the road but need them defined.

The case has been going on for two and a half years and has created headwinds in the U.S. market. A decision is expected from the judge sometime in the next three to six months, according to Garlinghouse.

The race to develop artificial intelligence (AI) continues as China pushes forward the development of home-grown AI without utilizing the latest technology from the United States due to current sanctions.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Chinese companies are studying methods to develop AI via weaker semiconductors and combinations of chips to bypass reliance on a single type of hardware. 

The report said researchers and analysts believe creating alternatives to such chips will be difficult for Chinese tech firms, but some experiments have shown “promise.”

Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against China in October 2022 have deprived Chinese companies of accessing the most advanced chips on the market. This includes Nvidia’s A100 chips and the latest version, the H100, which are the most popular options in AI development.

Currently, the Chinese market has access to Nvidia chips A800 and H800, which can only support small-scale AI models.

In April, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced it would roll out a ChatGPT competitor in the “near future” called Tongyi Qianwen. Alibaba plans to integrate the chatbot within its suite of applications, including its workplace messenger DingTalk.

Crypto-friendly Hong Kong is still gung-ho about giving its citizens access to crypto trading despite other jurisdictions “taking a step back,” claims the chair of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong (FTAHK).

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Hong Kong WOW Summit in March, FTAHK chair Neil Tan said while Singapore and the United States are seemingly stepping back from permitting crypto retail trading, “Hong Kong is stepping forward.”

On June 1, a licensing regime for crypto exchanges will come into effect, and Tan said it’s “going to also include retail.” The licensing guidelines are expected to be released sometime in May.

“If there’s access to [crypto] in a legal and regulated way, then I'm sure participants will come. It is a ‘build it and they will come’ because there are no other options. The options are dwindling, actually.”

In February, the region’s securities regulator proposed allowing retail traders access licensed crypto platforms in its licensing regime proposals for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).

It noted that denying access could push traders to unregulated overseas platforms. Currently, these platforms can only serve accredited professional investors.

In January, Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) CEO Julia Leung Fung-yee said that retail traders would be limited to “highly liquid” digital assets but did not give any further details.

Along with providing what many consider to be an attractive legal framework for crypto, Hong Kong is also focusing efforts on attracting talent and infrastructure providers — what Tan called “the back end.”

Related: China’s crypto stance unchanged by moves in Hong Kong, says exec

He added both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments recognize the opportunities in the region and are taking action to try to support inbound talent.

“There's a lot of talent across the border and right now there's a fair amount of unemployment,” Tan said on China. “There's a lot of talent that's coming from Big Tech and so forth that's able to come into Hong Kong.”

Infrastructure to support crypto also needs to be in place for Hong Kong to realize its virtual asset hub ambitions, Tan said. “When the platforms come, they come with that infrastructure. They bring the infrastructure with them as well to deliver the product,” he added.

He added the opening of the financial industry to digital assets was “just a natural progression” as cryptocurrencies “become a little bit more prominent.”

“People are actually adopting [crypto] inside of their portfolios. Whether you're talking about the retail side, high net worth or institutional investors, everyone's looking at their portfolios and trying to get that type of exposure.”

“Now we're back in business. We're opening it up.”

The Bitcoin mempool was clogged with over 400,000 transactions waiting to be processed at the time of writing. The mempool is known as the “waiting area” for incoming transactions before they are verified independently by each node on the network.

Binance tweeted that BTC withdrawals had resumed after nearly an hour of halting. Outflows on the crypto exchange peaked on May 7, rising to $187 million, according to data from CryptoQuant.

Behind the congestion is believed to be a surge in BRC-20 transactions in the last few days due to memecoins like Pepe (PEPE). The memecoin trading hype drove Bitcoin transaction fees to their highest point in two years. On May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping nearly 400% from late April, Cointelegraph reported.

Developed after Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard recently introduced that allows users to create and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is currently becoming a hot spot for meme tokens. 

CoinMarketCap’s data shows that PEPE’s price has climbed over 263% in the last week. As of writing, however, the memecoin is down over 7% following a 30% drop on May 6 as whales profited from Binance's recent listing. Crypto exchanges MEXC Global, Bitget, Gate.ioand Huobi listed PEPE trading pairs two weeks ago, kicking off the token hype.

Since the introduction of Dogecoin in 2013, memecoins have become a major part of the cryptocurrency world, making and ruining fortunes alike. Investopedia defines a memecoin as a cryptocurrency represented “with comical or animated memes, that [is] supported by enthusiastic online traders and followers.”

The government of Kazakhstan received 3.07 billion tenges (approximately $7 million) in tax payments from crypto mining entities in 2022 following the implementation of an amended law regulating the fiscal burden of mining cryptocurrencies, according to local media reports.

Preliminary data from the government for 2023 shows that mining fees collected by April 27 totaled 240 million tenges, over $541,000 at the time of writing. The figures are much lower than the 652 million tenge (~$1.5 million) in fees paid in the first quarter of 2022. 

Kazakhstan ranks among the world’s top Bitcoin mining hubs. As of January 2022, the Central Asian country contributed 13.22% of the total Bitcoin hash rate, just behind the United States (37.84%) and China (21.11%), according to data from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.

The country introduced taxes on digital mining on January 1, 2022, based on electricity consumption by mining entities. The law came into effect amid growing national frustration with crypto miners’ undertaxed usage of the national power grid, Cointelegraph reported. The amended legislation was also considered a legal path for further adoption amid tightening regulations worldwide.

A wave of foreign mining operators relocated to Kazakhstan during the 2021 bull market, impacting already tricky relations between the country and miners. Some estimates indicate that more than 87,849 rigs had been brought to the territory by November 2021 following China’s crackdown on mining activities.

Recently, the government announced plans to introduce new crypto regulations to curb tax fraud and unlawful business operations. One of the proposals calls for government approval for secured digital assets issuers, while another would require miners to sell at least 75% of crypto earned via registered exchanges. The move is expected to reduce tax evasion.

Crypto lending platform Celsius has reported that certain users will be able to take out 100% of their original funds more than 300 days after the platform froze withdrawals.

In a May 4 announcement, Celsius said eligible users would be able to withdraw the remaining 6% of distributable custody assets from the platform following court approval. Until January, the same users, largely those who only ever held funds in custody accounts, had been limited to withdrawing up to 94% of their funds.

The announcement marked progress in getting some Celsius customers reimbursed for missing funds for the first time since the company froze withdrawals in June 2022 before filin for bankruptcy in July. Many Celsius users reported a backlog of withdrawal attempts despite the funds supposedly being available, with some claiming requests had taken a matter of days to process.

According to court filings, Celsius was looking to combine its United Kingdom and United States entities, seemingly to have the two treated the same in bankruptcy proceedings. Celsius founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky is also facing a lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General’s office in January. Mashinsky filed a motion to dismiss on May 2, claiming the AG’s case “parrots misinformation.”

On May 4, Argentina's central bank banned payment providers from offering crypto transactions, alleging it intends to reduce the country's payment-system exposure to digital assets. 

According to a statement from the monetary authority, payment providers may not offer or facilitate crypto services through their applications. The move brings payment fintechs and financial institutions under the same rules in the country.

""Payment service providers that offer payment accounts [...] may not carry out or facilitate operations with digital assets, including crypto assets, that are not regulated by the competent national authority and authorized by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic,"" said the authority. Cryptocurrencies are not regulated in Argentina, which means all coins and tokens are subject to the decision.

It's unclear how the measure will affect the local crypto industry. Local media reported that payment providers refused to comment on the decision. Argentina's fintech chamber urged the government to reconsider the decision, claiming that ""it limits access to a technology that offers multiple benefits and opportunities for our society.""

Invitamos al BCRA a revisar esta medida y a trabajar en conjunto con la Cámara Argentina Fintech y otros actores relevantes del sistema para establecer un marco que permita el desarrollo responsable y sostenible de la industria cripto en Argentina.

Hyperinflation is driving crypto adoption in Argentina. In April, the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,775

 reached a record high in the Argentine peso (ARS), with the BTC exchange rate crossing over 6.59 million ARS — up more than 100% year-to-date.

In March, inflation in the country soared by 104.3% on an annual basis, following a 102.5% jump in the previous month, data from the national statistics office show.

Bitcoin’s popularity in the country also coincides with the ongoing devaluation of the Argentine peso, Cointelegraph reported. The currency has fallen almost 50% against the United States dollar in the past year.

Amid the ongoing economic crisis, even some Argentinian cities are seeking a safe haven in cryptocurrencies. Last December, the Argentine province of San Luis allowed the issuance of its own stablecoin pegged to the U.S dollar, available to all residents and 100% collateralized with liquid financial assets.

Chainalysis found that over 30% of consumers in Argentina use stablecoins for everyday purchases, most likely for small retail transactions under $1,000.

United States inflation and how it might affect the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,775

 are two of the top concerns on investors’ minds around the world. To illustrate, one prominent crypto personality bet big bucks on the future of the U.S. economy: the former Coinbase executive recently paid out $1.5 million to settle a Twitter wager about possible hyperinflation in the American economy.

The U.S. may not be experiencing hyperinflation, but the possibility of prices going out of control seems to concern the Federal Reserve. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point on May 3 — to the highest level in 16 years — pushing the target range for its benchmark from 5% to 5.25%.

As inflation pressures continue, Bitcoin is still seen as a safe haven for many, with crypto firms weighing on the digital currency to fight back inflation and turmoil in mainstream finance.

This week’s Crypto Biz explores the latest wild wager on Bitcoin prices, inflation fears and the jobs that artificial intelligence may soon replace.

Balaji pays out his crazy $1 million Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target

A closely watched wager between former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock has been closed, with Srinivasan paying $1.5 million to settle. The wager commenced on March 17 when Medlock offered to bet anyone $1 million that the United States would not experience hyperinflation. A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet, claiming that an impending crisis would lead to the deflation of the U.S. dollar and, thus, to a hyperinflation scenario, taking the BTC price to $1 million. As part of the deal, Srinivasan paid Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the nonprofit charity, Give Directly.

MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin conviction ‘strong’ as it posts Q1 profit

The Bitcoin investment strategy is as strong as ever at business intelligence platform MicroStrategy after the company posted its first quarterly profit since 2020. The firm returned to the green with a profit of $94 million, primarily attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million. The firm further reduced its leverage by repaying a $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank. The quarterly results were also impacted by a revenue rise of 2.2% from last year to $121.9 million. MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee said the firm would continue to execute its dual strategy of growing business intelligence software and acquiring Bitcoin. The firm believes its Bitcoin thesis is a “pretty good way to outperform the market.” 

Coinbase stock will be ‘weighed down’ until US rules are clear: Citi

Coinbase’s stock price will continue to be “weighed down” until regulators establish the legal “rules of the road” in the United States, Citi analysts say. The bank downgraded shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered its price target, citing “too many unknowns” as the company battles it out with regulators. However, bearish sentiment on Coinbase’s stock is not stopping investment firm ARK Invest from increasing its exposure to the crypto exchange. ARK purchased 168,869 Coinbase shares for its exchange-traded funds on May 1, worth nearly $8.5 million. In April, ARK bagged 304,300 shares worth $17.5 million. Previously, the firm bought 2.4 million shares in March for about $117 million.

Citi's analysis was published prior to Coinbase's Q1 earnings report released on May 4.

7,800 jobs at IBM could be replaced by AI within years, CEO suggests

IBM is expecting to put a “pause” on hiring for “back-office” roles that could be potentially automated by artificial intelligence instead. According to the company CEO, Arvind Krishna, back-office positions, such as those in human resources and accounting departments, will likely be the first to be automated by AI. Nearly 30% of these positions will “easily” be replaced by AI over five years, claimed Krishna in an interview. IBM employs 282,000 employees globally, according to LinkedIn data. Non-customer-facing staff sits at nearly 26,000. 

Before you go: The average person’s wealth will be ‘completely destroyed by inflation,' says Arthur Hayes

The majority of people will have their wealth progressively eaten away by the devaluation of money, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX. He believes the world’s largest economies will be forced to inflate away the sizeable public debt accumulated in the past years through money printing. With long-term inflation on the horizon, Hayes’s investment thesis focuses on preserving wealth through investing in digital assets.

CEO Tim Cook gave a rare, if guarded, glimpse into Apple’s walled garden during the Q&A portion of a recent earnings call when asked his thoughts on generative artificial intelligence (AI) and where he “sees it going.”

Cook refrained from revealing Apple’s plans, stating upfront, “We don’t comment on product roadmaps.” However, he did intimate that the company was interested in the space:

“I do think it’s very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things. And there’s a number of issues that need to be sorted. … But the potential is certainly very interesting.”

The CEO later added the company views “AI as huge” and would “continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.”

Cook’s comments on taking a “deliberate and thoughtful” approach could explain the company’s absence in the generative AI space. However, there are some indications that Apple is conducting its own research into related models.

A research paper scheduled to be published at the Interaction Design and Children conference this June details a novel system for combating bias in the development of machine learning datasets.

Bias — the tendency for an AI model to make unfair or inaccurate predictions based on incorrect or incomplete data — is oft-cited as one of the most pressing concerns for the safe and ethical development of generative AI models.

The paper, which can currently be read in preprint, details a system by which multiple users would contribute to developing an AI system’s dataset with equal input.

Status quo generative AI development doesn’t add in human feedback until later stages, when models have typically already gained training bias.

The new Apple research integrates human feedback at the very early stages of model development in order to essentially democratize the data selection process. The result, according to the researchers, is a system that employs a “hands-on, collaborative approach to introducing strategies for creating balanced datasets.”

Related: AI’s black box problem: Challenges and solutions for a transparent future

It bears mention that this research study was designed as an educational paradigm to encourage novice interest in machine learning development.

It could prove difficult to scale the techniques described in the paper for use in training large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. However, the research demonstrates an alternative approach to combating bias.

Ultimately, the creation of an LLM without unwanted bias could represent a landmark moment on the path to developing human-level AI systems.

Such systems stand to disrupt every aspect of the technology sector, especially the worlds of fintech, cryptocurrency trading and blockchain. Unbiased stock and crypto trading bots capable of human-level reasoning, for example, could shake up the global financial market by democratizing high-level trading knowledge.

Furthermore, demonstrating an unbiased LLM could go a long way toward satisfying government safety and ethical concerns for the generative AI industry.

This is especially noteworthy for Apple, as any generative AI product it develops or chooses to support would stand to benefit from the iPhone’s integrated AI chipset and its 1.5 billion user footprint.

The French bank BNP Paribas is collaborating with the Bank of China (BOC) to promote China’s digital currency, the digital yuan, to its corporate clients, the South China Morning Post reported.

The partnership will enable BNP Paribas China’s corporate clients to connect with the BOC system, allowing users to manage their digital yuan wallets by linking them to their bank accounts, track transactions and make payments using China’s digital currency via an e-CNY management system. The management system also promises to make it easier and more convenient for clients to use digital cash for real-time transactions.

The digital yuan management system can facilitate “efficient, real-time and convenient [digital cash] practice,” BNP shared, according to The South China Morning Post. 

BNP Paribas China also plans to explore the use of China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) in other areas, such as smart contracts, supply chain finance, utility and cross-border payments.

To promote the adoption of its CBDC, China handed out millions of dollars worth of digital yuan across the country during the Lunar New Year period. A number of cities reportedly gave away over 180 million yuan, amounting to $26.5 million worth of CBDCs in programs such as subsidies and consumption coupons.

In April, local news reported that the Chinese city of Changshu notified all civil servants within its jurisdiction that they would be paid their full salaries in digital yuan starting in May 2023. The payment terms apply to all civil servants in the public service and other state-owned units in the city. 

Despite the Chinese government’s efforts to promote the digital yuan, Hong Kong residents have not shown much enthusiasm for the government’s drive to promote the adoption of its CBDC. During the first four days of the hard launch of the digital yuan wallet, only 625 residents signed up, indicating a lukewarm response to the new digital currency offering.

PacWest Bancorp’s 50% price decline and the ongoing banking crisis are the first topics of this week’s show. The bank holds $40 billion in assets, although 80% of its lending portfolio has been assigned to commercial real estate loans and residential mortgages. The issue? As usual, rising interest rates. Meanwhile, the total underwater bond position of United States banks is $600 billion, not including derivatives.

However, the U.S. Treasury has been bailing out every one of the latest three bankruptcies: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and First Republic. SVB’s losses are estimated at $20 billion, or 15% of the total Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) capacity.

Pechman explains how Bitcoin’s 

BTC

 price should react in case PacWest Bancorp fails and why gold has recently flirted with its all-time high above $2,050. More importantly, how the banking crisis impacts government debt, which is spiraling out of control — consequently, extremely positive for Bitcoin in the long run.

The next concluding segment of Macro Markets focuses on oil prices, as the energy commodity traded down 17.5% in three weeks. Pechman shows how the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) doesn’t really control production and how the U.S. government played a key role in diminishing the demand for oil imports.

According to Pechman, the biggest take for Bitcoin is the potential oil demand flatline due to weaker economic conditions, which can be deemed a short-term negative driver for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

In recent years, emerging technologies have been pervasive in many major industries around the world, whether it’s blockchain technology used to help combat climate change or artificial intelligence (AI) projected to drive economic growth.

At the Metaverse Entertainment Worlds (MEWS) conference in Monaco, Cointelegraph sat down with Stephen Castell to discuss how emerging technologies are creating new ethics, changing the game for banks and more.

Castell is an expert witness in class-action lawsuits in the United States, has a Ph.D. in mathematics, and has been recently involved in major lawsuits involving crypto giants, such as Voyager and Binance.

Cointelegraph editor-in-chief Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr in conversation with Dr. Stephen Castell at MEWS 2023.

The legal expert began the talk by highlighting trust as a foundational theme in the emerging tech space. He tied trust to the recent banking crisis in the U.S. and commented that this was also a “fundamental idea of a bank” at its conception.

However, banks now “basically run on a bad business model,” he said. He pointed out that although the crypto community has visions to revolutionize the financial system through technological innovation, there needs to be regulation.

“Just because it’s crypto is different, there still are laws to protect investors, which govern crypto investments as much as they do any other potential investment.”

When it comes to emerging technologies like AI, Castell predicts that banks will be at the “forefront” of the adoption of such technology. 

“The banks are going to try and do it for the benefit of themselves,” he said. “To be safe, to have safe money, to have good investments, not to lose, not to go bust, not to solve the conundrum of what they do on a bank run.”

Castell continued to point out that, aside from benefiting banks, the introduction of AI into humanity will cause the “democratization and commoditization of intelligence.”

“It means that any human on the planet, maybe even some animals, too, can be just as intelligent and as creative as the most intelligent and most creative person that there’s ever been.”

He suggested that humans will need to be “socialized” with AI and other emerging technologies like the metaverse in order for it to be useful. 

“It’s still going to do something for us — useful, valuable, exciting, productive. It’s got to do all of those things if it’s going to become generic.”

AI has had no scarcity in use cases since it skyrocketed in popularity among the general public in recent months. Lawmakers in the United Kingdom are looking at the technology to be used as a tool for economic growth. 

In the crypto space, exchanges are implementing AI-based chatbots to help educate users on everything from industry news to token prices and events.

“I really hope that all the new technologies that we’re talking about actually will create new ethics for this new human species that we are.”

Castell believes that what is being seen now in the emerging tech space is just the beginning of what he called the “cyborgization” of humans.

In early April, software engineer Luke Sernau published a document on an internal system. The document was subsequently shared extensively among Google employees over the next few weeks. A source, who requested anonymity as they were not permitted to discuss internal company affairs, claimed that the document had been circulated thousands of times. On Thursday, the document was published by consulting firm SemiAnalysis and began to circulate in Silicon Valley.

According to Sernau’s assessment, Google’s competition with OpenAI had diverted attention from the swift progress in open-source technology. In his document, Sernau wrote that Google had focused excessively on keeping tabs on OpenAI’s progress. While both companies struggled to outperform each other, open-source technology had quietly advanced, surpassing Google and OpenAI in the AI race.

Google is known for investing in futuristic technologies, and its labs have played a significant role in developing the current AI-powered chatbots. However, OpenAI has emerged as a frontrunner in generative AI, which involves software that can create its own images, text and videos. OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022 and quickly gained popularity. Its sudden success has left Google sprinting to catch up in a key technology subfield.

However, Sernau argued that open-source communities pose a real threat to Google, as engineers are developing models rivaling the quality of those at Big Tech companies at a faster pace and lower cost. According to him, these models are more customizable, faster and more useful than Google’s own models. He also worried that clients might not be willing to pay for high-quality technology when it is available for free in open-source communities.

The vice president of the United States and President Joe Biden’s top advisers have held a meeting with several AI industry CEOs to discuss “concerns about the risks associated with AI.”

On May 4, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was joined by nine top Biden administration advisers in science, national security, policy and economics, meeting with the CEOs of OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and AI startup Anthropic.

Notably, tech giant Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting.

Before the meeting, the White House released a flurry of AI-related announcements regarding the funding of AI research facilities, government AI policy and AI systems evaluation.

The meeting focused on the transparency of AI systems, the importance of evaluating and validating the safety of AI and ensuring AI is secured from malicious actors, according to the announcement.

Reportedly, the government and the tech CEOs agreed “more work is needed to develop and ensure appropriate safeguards and protections” for AI.

The CEOs committed to engaging with the White House to ensure Americans can “benefit from AI innovation.” No specific details were shared on what safeguards were needed or what the engagement with the government exactly entails.

Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting despite Meta working on AI for years. A White House official told CNN, “It was focused on companies currently leading in the space.”

The Biden administration also highlighted its work to address national security concerns posed by AI, specifically mentioning cybersecurity and biosecurity, without going into specifics.

It said these efforts would ensure AI firms “have access to best practices” to protect AI networks from state cybersecurity experts from the “national security community.”

White House banks big on AI

On the same day, the Biden Administration announced it would put aside $140 million to launch seven new national AI research institutes, bringing the total to 25 across the country.

“These Institutes bolster America’s AI [research and development] infrastructure,” the White House said. It added the institutes would “drive breakthroughs” in areas such as “climate, agriculture, energy, public health, education, and cybersecurity.”

In a separate announcement, the government said AI development firms including Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Hugging Face and Stability AI will also participate in publicly evaluating AI systems on a platform from AI training firm Scale AI at the hacker convention DEFCON in August.

Finally, the White House said it would release a draft policy on how the U.S. government will use AI, which will be will be made available for public comment this summer.

Policies around the development, use and procurement of AI by federal departments and agencies will be drafted. It said the policies would be a model for state and local governments in their own procurement and use of AI.

Coinbase remains ‘100% committed’ to US market — Armstrong

Coinbase‘s CEO has a lot of faith that Congress will make a “clear rule book” for crypto firms to follow. But the Securities and Exchange Commission? Not so much.

United States-founded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has no plans to move its operations out of the U.S., CEO Brian Armstrong told investors in an Q1 earnings call.

On May 5, Armstrong assured shareholders that the firm is “100% committed” to the U.S. market over the long term despite regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.

“So let me be clear, we’re 100% committed to the U.S. I founded this company in the United States because I saw that rule of law prevails here. That’s really important, and I’m actually really optimistic on the U.S. getting this right.”

The optimism alluded to by Armstrong comes from his confidence in Congress soon passing a clear set of rules for crypto firms to follow:

“When I go visit DC, there is strong bipartisan support for Congress to come in and create new legislation that would create a clear rule book in the U.S. and I think it's really important for America to get this right.”

However, Armstrong’s comments weren’t entirely optimistic.

The CEO is concerned about the unpredictable enforcement action of the Securities Exchange Commission, which comes in light of the firm being served with a Wells notice by the securities regulator in late March:

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the commission, they have not been as clear about what their specific concerns are with Coinbase as we might like, and so I have to refrain from speculating too much.”

“It's especially difficult to predict the timeline of any potential SEC litigation that we might face,” Armstrong added.

The troubles led Coinbase to file an action in a U.S. federal court seeking to compel the SEC to answer a petition that has been pending since July.

The back and forth comes as Coinbase launched Coinbase International Exchange (CIE) on May 2, which prompted many pundits to believe that Coinbase was looking for an escape route from the U.S.

The exchange is open to customers in 30 countries worldwide, including Singapore, Hong Kong, El Salvador, Philippines, Thailand and Bermuda — where CIE is now licensed from.

Armstrong said the European Union is “in front” in terms of regulatory progress with its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation set to enter into effect in mid-2024 or early 2025:

“They've adopted comprehensive crypto legislation called MiCA, creates a single clear rule book for the entire region. It's pretty powerful.”

“I just got back from a trip from the U.K. and D.C. Both of those have draft bills in the works that are working on things like around stablecoins and market structure — Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil; all are essentially following in this direction,” Armstrong added.

The CEO’s remarks come as Coinbase managed to increase its first-quarter revenue by 22% while slashing its net income loss by over $475 million, to $79 million.

 revenue on its bellwether product Cash App in Q1.

According to a shareholder letter announcing its Q1 2023 earnings, Block (NYSE:SQ) reported that its Bitcoin revenue — which counts BTC revenue as total sales of the cryptocurrency to customers — was up 18% from $1.83 billion in Q4 and 25% from Q1 2022.

Cash App’s total profits reached over $931 million in the first quarter of 2023, marking a 49% increase year-over-year. Notably, Cash App’s profit paled compared to the company’s gross profit, which came in at $1.71 billion. Block also owns the popular business payment service Square, which reported a slight (3.8%) decline in profits from the fourth quarter of 2022.

According to the shareholder letter, the multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin revenues were driven by “an increase in the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers,” and were “partially offset” by a decrease in the market price of Bitcoin, compared to the same timeframe in 2022.

The fintech firm also reported an earning per share of 40 cents, beating analyst expectations of 35 cents per share by 14%, with its first-quarter revenue rising 26% year-on-year.

Speaking to investors in the earnings conference call, Block CEO Jack Dorsey identified both artificial intelligence and “open protocols” as technologies that would aid the company in proactively responding to the “significant shifts” in the global financial system He cited continued United States bank failures and de-dollarization as the primary culprits.

The equities market took kindly to Block’s earnings filings. The fintech firm’s share price briefly surged 5% to $63.50 in after-hours trading, before settling down to a 2.5% gain at the time of publication.

This uptick marked the first instance of relief from a steady decline in Block’s share price, which suffered a significant 25% hit following the release of a scathing report penned by famed short sellers Hindenburg Research.

On March 23, Hindenburg slammed Block for “systematically taking advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping,” and declared that Block’s success with Cash App only hinged on a “willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government.”

“Hindenburg is known for these types of attacks, which are designed solely to allow short sellers to profit from a declined stock price,” wrote Block in response to Hindenburg’s allegations. “We have reviewed the full report in the context of our own data and believe it’s designed to deceive and confuse investors.”

Funds stuck on the platform of bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital may begin returning to creditors in “the next few weeks,"" according to a committee of Voyager creditors.

A May 4 tweet from the Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (UCC) said the now-defunct crypto firm is in the final stages of bankruptcy liquidation procedures. The UCC is “hopeful” that “initial distributions will begin within the next few weeks.”

The UCC’s update comes 10 days after Binance.US backed out of its initial agreement to purchase $1.02 billion worth of Voyager’s assets, with the crypto exchange blaming “the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States” as the reason for abandoning the deal.

Fortunately, Voyager’s restructuring plan includes a “toggle option” that allows the firm to pursue self-liquidation following the decision by Binance.US to pull out of the deal. This allows the bankrupt broker to distribute cash and crypto to customers directly via the Voyager platform.

The UCC was dismayed by Binance.US’ move, stating that it would be investigating potential claims against the cryptocurrency exchange for its last-minute change of heart.

It’s worth noting that Voyager must now file the liquidation procedures with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. According to the committee, parties have 10 days to file any objections with the liquidation procedures.

The UCC explained if no objections are filed in the next 10 days then “Voyager will “go ‘effective"" with the plan.” If an objection is filed, however, the court will hold a hearing to consider the objection before the liquidation plan can go through.

An overwhelming majority, 97%, of the 61,300 Voyager customers who voted on the court’s restructuring plan voted in favor, although at that time voters believed that Binance.US would acquire the stranded assets.

Crypto exchange Coinbase managed to significantly narrow its net loss in the first quarter of 2023, due in part to robust earnings from retail investor trading activity.

The company’s net loss fell from $557 million in Q4 2022 to $79 million in Q1, partly attributed to a 22% increase in revenue to $736 million.

The results beat expectations from some analysts, leading to a 7% spike in Coinbase’s share price in after-hours trading.

Transaction revenue — the fees it charges for trades — from its institutional base increased a whopping 66% to over $22.3 million, while transaction revenue from retail investors increased 14.1% to $352.1 million, according to Coinbase’s May 4 shareholder letter.

Overall, revenue from transactions increased 16% quarter-on-quarter to $375 million, though trading volumes remained fairly flat.

Interest income and blockchain rewards from staking brought in the most revenue for the quarter, which increased to $240.8 million and $73.7 million respectively from Q4 2022.

 (18%) trades remained almost identical over the quarter.

The firm is inching closer to profitability following a tumultuous 2022 that saw net losses of $1.16 billion, $803 million, $576 million and $605 million across each respective quarter last year.

Coinbase said that the quarter represented a “turning point” toward building a more “efficient” and “financially disciplined” firm:

“We reduced costs, doubled down on operational excellence and risk management, and continue to drive product innovation and regulatory clarity. Our efforts are showing meaningful progress.”

“Our teams are smaller, but more nimble than ever and we are pleased with the pace of innovation and the results we are seeing,” the firm added.

Coinbase cut staff by 18% in June and then another 20% in January, to ensure that the firm maintains an appropriate level of “operational efficiency,” Armstrong said.

Coinbase’s comments were made in light of the Wells notice hanging over its head from the United States Securities Exchange Commission:

""We see this as an opportunity to continue pushing for a clear rule book in the U.S. for crypto regulations.""

The firm said it is “heartened” to see more bipartisan support for incoming crypto legislation and hopes to play a role in advocating for a rules-based industry.

Microsoft recently announced a slew of new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features for its Bing chatbot and Edge web browser. Chief among the changes, Bing users now have full access to the GPT-4 model — the same underlying engine that powers ChatGPT’s “Plus” subscription service.

Previously, Microsoft held access to the GPT-4 version of the Bing chatbot to a “limited preview.” It’s now announcing open availability through the Bing app, web access and the Edge browser.

Aside from giving Bing, Edge and Windows users free, unfettered access to the GPT-4 model, Microsoft also announced upcoming support for multimodal outputs, chat history and plug-ins.

Multimodal support will allow the Bing chatbot to generate responses, which include a combination of text, images and videos. It will also have the ability to generate charts and graphs, something that could give it a leg up over ChatGPT.

Users will also have access to their full chat history and, for those using the Edge browser, the ability to move chats to the sidebar to continue surfing in the same tab. Microsoft says this feature will be implemented “starting shortly.”

In the future, according to the blog post, Bing may even be able to reference previous sessions when interacting with users:

“Over time, we’re exploring making your chats more personalized by bringing context from a previous chat into new conversations.”

Perhaps the most ambitious addition announced is “Edge Actions,” also referred to as “Bing Actions,"" Microsoft’s term for upcoming integrations featuring third-party plug-ins for Bing chat.

The only plug-ins specifically mentioned in the announcement are OpenTable, which would allow users to reserve seats at restaurants directly within the chat interface, and Wolfram/Alpha, a modality that would allow users to create complex visualizations for math and science queries. Microsoft says more integrations will be revealed as they’re implemented.

The new features won’t require any purchases or subscriptions, though users will need a free Microsoft account to take advantage of the Bing chatbot’s full suite of functions.

By contrast, OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus service costs $20 per month for access to the same GPT-4 model (the freely available ChatGPT service relies on GPT-3.5). Furthermore, ChatGPT Plus doesn’t currently offer image generation, web search or third-party plug-in support.

It’s unclear how Microsoft and OpenAI intend to balance their respective offerings. Experts weighing in on social media have expressed confusion over what appears to be competition for users, as the companies essentially partnered up after Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI.

As it currently stands, those paying for ChatGPT Plus do receive certain benefits not available to the general public or Bing chatbot users. These include early access to new features, priority access to the system even during periods of high traffic and faster response times from the model.

The cryptocurrency world has seen an explosion of interest in chatbot technologies throughout 2023. Developers have built advanced autonomous trading bots on the GPT-4 platform, and many individual crypto users have begun employing chatbots for a variety of reasons.

It’s unknown at this time if OpenAI intends to adjust its subscription offering in the face of Bing’s ubiquity — Microsoft says the search engine now boasts 100 million users, while the addition of Bing AI to the Windows taskbar gives it a potential global reach of more than half a billion users per month.

Arbitrum’s Chronos reaches $217M TVL with staking, becomes 8th largest DEX

Chronos set a new TVL milestone just seven days after its launch on the Arbitrum blockchain as DEXs draw traders amid regulatory uncertainty in the United States.

Decentralized exchange (DEX) Chronos set a new milestone on May 4, reaching $217 million in total value locked (TVL) at the time of writing, just seven days after its launch on the Arbitrum blockchain. 

With the new TVL figures, Chronos ranks eighth among the largest decentralized exchanges, according to DefiLlama. In DeFi, TVL represents the funds held or staked within a protocol. 

The TVL milestone was achieved during the first hours of the day after the protocol kicked off Epoch 1, which enabled Chronos (CHR) token emissions to liquidity pools. The initiation of Epoch 1 also allowed stakers to begin collecting rewards.

Chronos debuted on April 27 to serve as a liquidity provider and automated market maker for the Arbitrum network, hosting core pools such as Chronos-Ether (CHR/ETH) and Chronos-USD Coin (CHR/USDC), both seeded with 2 million CHR tokens, along with Arbitrum-Ether (ARB/ETH), Ether-USD Coin (ETH/USDC), USD Coin-Tether (USDC/USDT) and Wrapped Bitcoin-Ether (WBTC/ETH) pools.

Decentralized exchanges are at the heart of DeFi and are showing signs of growth and maturity after 2022’s crypto winter. “After [the] FTX bankruptcy, the industry saw the real value of DEXs. Decentralization that DEXs bring matters more than ever,"" noted Charles Wayn, co-founder of Web3 community platform Galxe, explaining that DEXs and wallets will be the backbones of gaming adoption in the coming years.

Likewise, chief technology officer of Maverick Protocol Bob Baxley told Cointelegraph that the past year has served as a proof-of-concept for DEXs and DeFi. “After all, if you look at some major DEXs, on some days they’re doing more volume than Coinbase,"" he said, noting that the tightening regulatory environment in the United States is likely to benefit DEXs:

“If centralized on-ramps into the crypto ecosystem continue to get cut off in places like the United States, then we could see more and more people turning to DEXs for performing their trading.”

DEXs are peer-to-peer marketplaces where crypto traders transact without turning over their funds to intermediaries or custodians. Smart contracts power these self-executing transactions. However, as we’ve seen over the past few years, hacks and bugs are among the biggest risks of trading on DEXs. 

“I suspect volumes for a wide variety of DEXs will eventually grow at an exponential rate, especially when the underlying blockchains like Ethereum continue to scale and, in turn, offer more throughput for lower gas prices,"" Brent Xu, founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, told Cointelegraph.

Imagine coming home and opening your fridge to find a jar filled with your favorite juice. After taking a sip, you realize that the kind soul who prepared the juice added too much water, and there's not much you can do to fix it — removing water from juice is a complicated process. However, if instead the juice-maker was too stingy with water, you can simply dilute the juice with extra water and enjoy a perfect refreshing drink.

A similar phenomenon happens with the risk of financial assets. If an asset has too little risk, it is complicated to “remove water” and make it riskier, usually through leverage. On the contrary, if the asset is too risky, it is straightforward to dilute it with cash equivalents, such as short-term Treasury Bills, or T-Bills.

Crypto assets have emerged as a new asset class in the past 14 years. As they've gained popularity, debates have arisen about their role in a portfolio of traditional assets. The controversy largely stems from concerns about the level of risk associated with these assets, which is significantly higher than that of even the riskiest traditional assets.

Well, instead of complaining about the high risk, one can add some water (e.g., T-Bills) and then check how well the diluted crypto assets fit in a traditional assets portfolio. This is precisely what we did. We took three years of post-pandemic data, from second quarter 2020 until first quarter 2023, for indices representing (global) equities (the MSCI World Index), (global) bonds (the Bloomberg Global Agg Credit Total Return Index Value Hedged USD), short-term T-Bills (the Bloomberg 1-3 Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index), and crypto. The next step was to dilute crypto with T-Bills. We chose two parts crypto for three parts T-Bills, which led to volatility levels that were less than double what is typical for equities.

The grand finale is three-fold: We took all the portfolios ranging from 1% to 99% equity with the rest allocated to bonds (quarterly rebalance was used in all the simulations), which we called original portfolios; determined how much of the equity portion could be replaced by diluted crypto maintaining the same level of volatility, which led us to the final portfolios; and analyzed what happens with other relevant portfolio metrics. The chart below summarizes the results.

The red line (left axis) shows how much crypto (both diluted and pure) is in the final portfolios. As expected, the more equity in the original portfolio, the more room for crypto. The straight line indicates that there is a linear relationship (technically, an affine relationship once it doesn’t cross the origin) between these two variables, which can be found by a simple regression. The regression reveals that the amount of pure crypto in any given final portfolio is determined by this formula: 0.17% plus 6.40% times the fraction of equities in its respective original portfolio. Although this relationship is based on these specific indices, there are no reasons to expect significantly different behaviors for portfolios with different allocations in equities and bonds, or even for those that also include other asset classes. So, this formula can be viewed as a general rule of thumb for juicing up a portfolio by replacing equities for crypto.

But what is the impact of swapping equities for diluted crypto? We can get some hints from the blue line on the graph above (right axis). Despite crypto's small proportion in the portfolio, there are substantial gains in risk-adjusted returns (measured by the Sharpe ratio), ranging from 0.05 to 0.25. This indicates that the final portfolios delivered significantly higher returns than their original counterparts while maintaining the same level of volatility. Additionally, the chart shows that the more crypto that is added to the portfolio, the greater the observed increase in Sharpe ratio.

Just to give more color to these numbers, we can take the example of the traditional 60% equities and 40% bonds allocation. This portfolio returned 7.6% yearly in our analysis period with annualized volatility of 11.4%, resulting in a Sharpe ratio of 0.59. Using the formula, the final portfolio has 4% in crypto (0.17% + 6.40 x 60% = 4%), 6% in T-Bills (4% x 1.5 = 6%), 50% in equities (60% - 4% - 6% = 50%) and 40% in bonds. As expected, the volatility is the same as the original portfolio, but the return grew to 10.2%, leading to a Sharpe ratio of 0.82, 1.4 times greater.

As these simulations indicate, the discussion shouldn’t be around whether there is room for crypto in a traditional assets portfolio. Instead, we should be talking about how best to allocate to this asset class. The formula above summarizes a simple approach that delivers good results. If you’re still skeptical about investing in crypto, take a glass of your preferred juice with the right concentration of water and think about it while you drink.

With the new TVL figures, Chronos ranks eighth among the largest decentralized exchanges, according to DefiLlama. In DeFi, TVL represents the funds held or staked within a protocol. 

The TVL milestone was achieved during the first hours of the day after the protocol kicked off Epoch 1, which enabled Chronos (CHR) token emissions to liquidity pools. The initiation of Epoch 1 also allowed stakers to begin collecting rewards.

Chronos debuted on April 27 to serve as a liquidity provider and automated market maker for the Arbitrum network, hosting core pools such as Chronos-Ether (CHR/ETH) and Chronos-USD Coin (CHR/USDC), both seeded with 2 million CHR tokens, along with Arbitrum-Ether (ARB/ETH), Ether-USD Coin (ETH/USDC), USD Coin-Tether (USDC/USDT) and Wrapped Bitcoin-Ether (WBTC/ETH) pools.

Decentralized exchanges are at the heart of DeFi and are showing signs of growth and maturity after 2022’s crypto winter. “After [the] FTX bankruptcy, the industry saw the real value of DEXs. Decentralization that DEXs bring matters more than ever,"" noted Charles Wayn, co-founder of Web3 community platform Galxe, explaining that DEXs and wallets will be the backbones of gaming adoption in the coming years.

Likewise, chief technology officer of Maverick Protocol Bob Baxley told Cointelegraph that the past year has served as a proof-of-concept for DEXs and DeFi. “After all, if you look at some major DEXs, on some days they’re doing more volume than Coinbase,"" he said, noting that the tightening regulatory environment in the United States is likely to benefit DEXs:

“If centralized on-ramps into the crypto ecosystem continue to get cut off in places like the United States, then we could see more and more people turning to DEXs for performing their trading.”

DEXs are peer-to-peer marketplaces where crypto traders transact without turning over their funds to intermediaries or custodians. Smart contracts power these self-executing transactions. However, as we’ve seen over the past few years, hacks and bugs are among the biggest risks of trading on DEXs. 

“I suspect volumes for a wide variety of DEXs will eventually grow at an exponential rate, especially when the underlying blockchains like Ethereum continue to scale and, in turn, offer more throughput for lower gas prices,"" Brent Xu, founder of Web3 bond-market platform Umee, told Cointelegraph.

One of the most critical issues in the Web3 space that needs to be resolved as soon as possible is the blockchain trilemma in addressing decentralization, security, and scalability. Only then can this industry achieve mainstream adoption.

To solve this trilemma, the industry needs talent. However, attracting and retaining top professionals is the biggest pain point and bottleneck for every Web3 startup and DAO project. To keep the innovation engine humming, the Web3 industry needs to take a closer look at the available gallant tools to get professionals on board.

The Web3 talent pool offers a diverse range of expertise with a focus on multitasking and remote working, a new study revealed. The research, titled “Web3 Talent Survey,” is conducted by Intropia — a community-driven Web3 talent ecosystem. To understand and explore the attitudes and preferences of professionals looking into the Web3 space, Intropia surveyed over 6,000 respondents during the second half of 2022.

According to the research, a typical Web3 contributor — a term Intropia uses to broadly define talent working in the Web3 space — is between 25 and 44 years old and has been working professionally for more than five years. Fitting to the decentralized nature of Web3, community-related skills top the list as the most common primary skill set for Web3 contributors (16%). This is followed by skills focused on research (10%), engineering (9%) and product (7%).

Freelancers and part-time contributors lead the way when it comes to defining roles in the Web3 ecosystem, according to the report. One-fifth of respondents have full-time roles in decentralized anonymous organizations (DAOs), while 15% act as founding members in a DAO.

The ever-expanding universe of crypto and Web3 requires a knack for learning in order to keep up with the innovations and new trends introduced to the space on an almost monthly basis. So, it’s not surprising that the vast majority of Web3 contributors have a higher education and spend 8 to 32 hours each week on self-education. Those who learn also want to educate their network by teaching and mentoring others, the report emphasizes. Web3 professionals read articles and papers, attend courses or simply watch in-depth videos on YouTube to stay ahead of the curve.

What are professionals looking for in Web3?

The decentralized structure of the Web3 space is again reflected in the fact that the majority of respondents work on more than one project. More than 80% of respondents in the Intropia survey are working on multiple projects at once, which has become an industry standard. This also translates to the average weekly work hours of Web3 contributors. The report states that every third respondent works more than 32 hours per week.

When it comes to the types of projects, Web3 professionals are looking for opportunities in layer-1 networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains, layer-2 solutions like Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, and decentralized apps (DApps).

“Web3 is like a club, with smart, like-minded individuals who are working toward a common goal,” the report summarizes, noting that more than half of the respondents (over 57%) rated their enjoyment of working in the Web3 space at 10 out of 10. The main concerns that stood out were scam projects, the fear of missing out (FOMO), and the slow rate of adoption.

The report urges projects seeking to hire Web3 professionals to embrace the diversity of the ecosystem. Because word-of-mouth is strong in the Web3 space, the top talent primarily uses referrals as a way to find their next gig. With a deeper understanding of the available talent pool, the industry will move forward with the next wave of innovation.

Final thoughts

The Web3 space is a thriving ecosystem that is continuously evolving. With its decentralized structure, Web3 professionals are creating innovative solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems. The industry's growth and popularity are reflected in the increasing number of projects, the hours worked by contributors, and the overall satisfaction of working in the space.

As the industry continues to expand, it is essential to address the concerns of Web3 professionals, such as scam projects and the slow rate of adoption. By taking a proactive approach to these issues, the industry can ensure that talented individuals remain engaged and motivated to work in the Web3 space. It is also crucial for projects seeking to hire Web3 professionals to foster an inclusive and diverse working culture that values collaboration and innovation. With these steps, the Web3 space can continue to grow and push the boundaries of what is possible.

Being stuck at home for almost two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are eager to experience new cities, countries and cultures. The flexibility of working from home now allows travelers to plan around a less home-bound lifestyle. However, age-old problems, including delayed or canceled transportation, lost luggage and check-in mixups, continue to trouble the travel industry, which is expected to tap $850 billion in revenue by the end of 2023.

People rightly have high expectations for their travel experience, including low cost, better security, transparency and personalisation. These demands can be met with the help of peer-to-peer (P2P) connections, decentralized networks, fast transactions and interoperable systems that enable seamless data exchange.

That's why the travel industry needs blockchain solutions. The transparent, scalable and secure nature of blockchain technology can reduce costs, increase efficiency and foster collaboration to provide a more streamlined and personalised experience for travellers.

However, current blockchain networks fail to meet the needs of the highly-specialized nature of the travel industry, which works with fragmented processes across multiple stakeholders and where trust and regulatory compliance are crucial. A uniquely-designed blockchain is needed today to act as a layer 1 infrastructure to address the specific requirements of the travel industry.

Industry pioneers joined forces for efficiency

Seeing how blockchain can improve the current travel experience for all parties, industry pioneers, stakeholders and Web3 professionals come together to launch an inclusive blockchain ecosystem named Camino Network to pave the way for innovation in the multi-billion dollar industry. Supported by the travel giants like TUI, Lufthansa, Miles & More and Eurowings, Camino Network lays the groundwork for an entire ecosystem of Web3 travel apps and services.

Built on Avalanche’s technical base, Camino’s blockchain is tailored specifically for the travel ecosystem. The project leverages the next-generation capabilities of this technology to bring efficiency, security and innovation to the travel industry with the aim to provide better, more personalized experiences for travelers around the world.

Cutting down transaction costs by using blockchain helps with reducing fees for both businesses and users. A number of key players from the travel industry announced their backing for the Camino Network, with over 80 of them directly supporting the infrastructure by acting as initial validators of the blockchain.

NFTs and digital wallets for personalized travel experience

Despite being an essential need for travelers, updating hotel and accommodation info needs constant effort with legacy infrastructures. The information flow is bound by multiple bilateral contracts and interfaces, commonly resulting in outdated info for guests. Camino uses blockchain for more streamlined data management across all parties with nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

While NFTs are mainly known as digital collectibles in the Web3 space, the travel industry presents immense potential to go beyond one use case and introduce actual utility. Similarly, the travel industry can benefit from the flexibility and reliability of NFTs for many legs or a travel experience, making it an ideal match. With NFTs, it becomes possible to produce hotel or other key travel info as a unique digital token, where the info is stored in a decentralized manner. The crucial info NFT contains can be automatically updated whenever new information becomes available, keeping the latest version of data for all parties involved. With better management tools and systems developed for the Web3 era, the Camino Network enables all stakeholders in the industry to benefit from a secure and transparent ecosystem.

NFTs can also help with the tokenization of assets of inventory, potentially bringing a new marketplace where everything about the travel experience can be sold and exchanged for a much wider range of personalization. An NFT can act as digital ownership proof for travel-related assets, from flight tickets to hotel rooms and loyalty points, introducing a new level of reliability to the industry by solving fraud and payment risks. It also takes the stress out of last-minute decisions, a common headache for both customers and airlines, by making it easy to resell any tickets for both customers and airlines. Camino Network can serve as the basis for an NFT-based voucher platform to remove manual and lengthy processes from redeeming travel coupons with smart contracts. With a broad range of use cases, NFTs will provide new revenue streams and pave the way for new business models within the travel industry.

The next chapter of travel is taking off

To provide a safe and secure environment for Web3 developers, over 200,000 lines of code written for the Camino blockchain were audited by prominent cybersecurity service provider Hexens. The team also launched a hacker bounty hunt for the Camino Network to prove its reliability.

Web3 developers and travel companies who aim to transform the industry have already started working on the Camino Network for a wide range of decentralized apps. The Camino Network invites everyone — both from the travel industry and the Web3 space — to join hands to prepare an age-old industry for the next generation of travelers.

Consensus, the annual crypto and blockchain conference, attracted over 15,000 attendees, 220 sponsors and 410 speakers to its 2023 edition in Austin, Texas, despite recent regulatory struggles around cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. 

The turnout at Consensus 2023 demonstrated that U.S.-based companies and international organizations are still very much interested in implementing Web3 technology into their business models.

Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank — a Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the conference attracted serious ecosystem participants, saying, “We’ve seen during crypto winters before where Consensus gets overrun with high time preference people and companies (for example, multiple Lambo’s parked out front of the New York Hilton in 2018), and in bust years the low-time preference people and companies just keep building. This year was the latter.”

Businesses discuss Web3 strategies

Several large organizations were present at Consensus 2023, with Mastercard, Google, Robinhood and Coinbase, among others, gathering to discuss their Web3 strategies.

James Tromans, head of Web3 at Google Cloud, told Cointelegraph about some blockchain-based initiatives the company has recently launched.

“At the end of last year, Google Cloud announced Blockchain Node Engine, which allows users and developers to run an Ethereum node without having to manage or support it themselves,” he said.

At Consensus, the firm announced that it had expanded support for the Blockchain Node Engine to Polygon proof-of-stake, in addition to Ethereum.

Tromans added that Google Cloud knows what Polygon has been doing in the zero-knowledge (ZK) space, noting that Polygon ZK Ethereum virtual machines (zkEVM) and Polygon supernets will benefit from the provision of Google Cloud’s infrastructure and developer tools.

Moreover, Tromans pointed out that Google Cloud’s startup program will help onboard companies interested in building on Web3 using existing Google Cloud products. “Polygon is an important part of this initiative, as they have provided a $3 million contribution from their venture fund to get this off the ground with us,” he said.

Global financial services giant Mastercard announced its “Mastercard Crypto Credential” solution during Consensus. Raj Dhamodharan, head of crypto and blockchain at Mastercard, stated during a fireside discussion at Consensus that he is “excited about the underlying potential of blockchain technology” due to its ability to store and move value seamlessly.

However, Dhamodharan explained that “this potential is not fully realized today,” so Mastercard has started working on several products like Mastercard Crypto Credential.

“I believe that once you have the right building blocks necessary for safety and simplicity, you can have more businesses building and relying on the basic utility of storing and moving value,” Dhamodharan said on stage.

Conversations continued at side events

While there were 10 dedicated stages for 285 panels during Consensus, many side events allowed important conversations to continue outside of the conference.

For example, zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) were widely discussed at Consensus, but in-depth conversations around ZK-proofs took place at the “ZK360” event hosted by Mina Protocol. Evan Shapiro, CEO of the Mina Foundation and co-founder of the Mina Protocol, told Cointelegraph that the goal of ZK360 was for attendees to learn about the latest advancements in ZK-proofs and how these can be applied in the real world. “Web3 needs both privacy and verified computation. ZK-proofs provide both of those at a time when applications are needing these features to be more effective, decentralized and scalable,” he said.

Other layer-1 blockchain networks like Ripple and Algorand hosted side events, allowing Consensus attendees to better understand specific blockchain offerings while networking with community members. These events also presented an opportunity for non-Consensus attendees to learn about important topics within the Web3 sector. 

Lacking an international presence

While the turnout during Consensus 2023 was notable, some industry experts highlighted that the conference lacked an international presence.

Yat Siu, chairman of Animoca Brands — a venture capital company focused on blockchain-based games — told Cointelegraph that regions in Asia like Japan and Hong Kong are offering a progressive and welcoming regulatory environment for crypto adoption. He noted that most people he spoke with at Consensus seemed surprised or even skeptical at this. He said:

“I think that a larger presence of overseas participants would have helped allow Consensus participants to better understand the scope of excitement and opportunity that exists outside of the United States. I would love to see a stronger international presence at Consensus next year.”

Despite this, Siu said that Consensus 2023 was a well-attended, high-energy conference overall. “I was surprised at the level of deal-making activity that was taking place, even if the narrative was that the U.S. was negative on crypto,” he said.

Echoing Siu was Keith Grossman, president of enterprise at MoonPay. He told Cointelegraph that he was impressed to see so many executives from some of the largest companies in attendance at Consensus. “Deals were being discussed, and I believe we will look back at Consensus 2023 recognizing it represented a maturation in the industry as it relates to how Web3 technologies can be deployed in a meaningful manner for businesses and their customers.”

""The platform will also collaborate with other leading blockchain firms to incubate innovative projects by young entrepreneurs and host U30 (Under the age of 30) hackathons to identify the most promising ones.""

Blockchain4Youth will commence this month with a series of campus lectures on Web3 held in universities across Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand. Bitget Academy courses will also be available around the same time. The exchange says it is open to partnerships with educators for its novel initiative. Currently, Bitget has around 8 million users across more than 100 countries.

According to a recent Bitget survey involving more than 250,000 respondents, 46% of millennials across major economies such as the United States, China, Japan, Germany, Nigeria and Indonesia currently own cryptocurrencies compared to 25% of Gen X, 21% of Gen Z and 8% of baby boomers. Furthermore, 27% of millennials and 36% of Gen Z respondents said they considered cryptocurrency regulation an important factor when voting for political candidates. 

In a similar venture, Binance Charity pledged to provide more than 30,000 scholarships in 2023. At the time, over 82,000 applicants were interested in joining the next cohort, equating to an acceptance rate of about 37%. The organization says it has committed $23 million to 32 Web3 social projects since its inception in 2018.

Bloomberg, Dow Jones, The New York Times and the Financial Times first filed a motion objecting to FTX and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors being authorized to redact and withhold customer information on Jan 11.

While the court previously had heard similar arguments by the four firms, the May 3 filing made a new objection to the Committee’s motion to seal the identities of non-U.S. customers.

The media outlet's most recent argument is that there is no legal basis to redact the names pursuant to non-U.S. data privacy laws.

The media giants argued that under section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code — the provision which grants the bankruptcy court judicial power — there is no part that permits foreign law to override the right of access to information under U.S. constitutional and statutory law:

“At bottom, Movants desire to avoid ‘enforcement of the public disclosure requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law’ [...] furnishes no basis for sealing.”

“The law of the United States — constitutional and statutory — guarantees the public a strong presumptive right to inspect bankruptcy filings. That right cannot be abrogated by a party’s assertion of legal obligations under foreign law,” the media firms added.

The first argument raised — which was claimed in an earlier filing — was that the names of FTX’s creditors do not constitute “confidential commercial information.”

The second — also raised in an earlier filing — is that such disclosure wouldn’t subject the creditors to “undue risk.”

FTX and the committee have until May 4 at 4:00 pm Eastern Time to submit an objection.

The hearing date for the filing will take place on May 17 at 1:00pm.

Share prices of several United States regional banks tanked in after-hours trading on May 3, despite Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell calling the banking sector “sound” and “resilient” just hours before.

One such regional bank, PacWest Bancorp, fell a whopping 52.5% in after-hours trading after Bloomberg reported that the bank would explore strategic options on May 4. It has been seen by some as another bank to potentially fall amid a U.S. banking crisis.

The bank is reportedly considering a sale or capital raising, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Meanwhile, Western Alliance Bancorp (22.4%), Metropolitan Bank (16.2%) and HomeStreet (7.8%) were among the other hardest-hit regional banks.

Metropolitan Bank once offered services to crypto firms but closed its digital asset vertical in January because the firm wasn’t content with how the cryptocurrency industry was developing.

Western Alliance Bancorp also integrated blockchain-based payment solutions for its client base from the firm’s blockchain and digital asset branch.

Powell’s attempt to quell concerns about the banking sector came as he announced that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates another 25 basis points:

“Conditions in [the banking] sector have broadly improved since early March and the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector.""

Powell added that Fed was “committed to learning the right lessons from this episode, and we’ll work to prevent events like these from happening again.”

First Republic Bank’s collapse was the second-biggest bank failure of late. Problems first surfaced on April 26, when the news about a government receivership broke out, causing the bank’s share price to plummet 20% in hours.

Several on Crypto Twitter have mocked Powell for stating that conditions in the banking sector “have broadly improved” since early March.

Will Clemente, the founder of digital asset analysis firm Reflexivity Research, tweeted to his 680,300 Twitter followers that the collapse of five banks — SVB, Silvergate, Signature, First Republic and PacWest — “sounds like a very sound and resilient banking system…”

Twitter user Zerohedge made fun of Powell by noting to the1.6 million followers that over $500 billion has been wiped out from “bank failures” in the past month alone.

PacWest Bancorp’s 52% fall is set to wipe out about $340 million from its market cap, which was $772 million at the May 3 close, according to Google Finance.

Crypto exchange Coinbase is stopping the issuance of new loans through its Borrow service, a product that allowed certain United States customers to post crypto as collateral to receive a cash loan.

In an email sent to Coinbase Borrow customers on May 3 that was shared by recipients on Twitter, the exchange said — without providing a reason — that from May 10, customers wouldn’t be able to take out new loans using Coinbase Borrow.

It added that there would be no impact on outstanding loans, and customers did not need to take any further action.

Coinbase has not publicly addressed why it was closing Borrow. A Coinbase spokesperson told Cointelegraph:

""We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we’re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most.”

The service allowed users to borrow from the exchange against up to 40% of their Bitcoin

 holdings, with a $1 million limit. It required no credit check, with users paying a nearly 9% annual percentage rate for the service.

The announcement is in the backdrop of a regulatory scuffle between Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which sent the exchange a Wells notice in March that the exchange said was in relation to “possible violations of securities laws.”

The email to users also precedes its first quarter results announcement, which is expected on May 4.

Investment analysts from Citi downgraded Coinbase shares from “buy” to “neutral” ahead of the exchange’s Q1 earnings. Analysts from Mizuho also reportedly maintained its “underperform” rating on Coinbase, saying its “fundamentals remain weak,” citing lower average daily trading volumes.

Earlier this week, amid an apparent crackdown on crypto firms in the U.S., Coinbase decided to take its exchange global, launching the Coinbase International Exchange derivatives trading platform on May 2.

SEC steps back from defining digital assets in new hedge fund rules

The United States securities regulator is holding off from ratifying the definition of the term “digital assets” in rules that govern reporting disclosures for hedge and private equity funds, despite proposing to do so some nine months ago.

On May 3 the Securities and Exchange Commission published amendments to Form PF — a form that SEC-registered funds complete to disclose basic information about their fund so the regulator can assess potential “systemic risks.”

The SEC originally included a digital assets definition in an August 2022 proposal for the changes. If it went into effect, it would have been the first time the SEC defined “digital assets.”

Fast forward to today, and the regulator says it’s not going ahead with adding the definition, at least for now.

“We proposed adding ‘digital assets’ as a new term to the Form PF Glossary of Terms. The Commission and staff are continuing to consider this term and are not adopting ‘digital assets’ as part of this rule at this time.”

The definition the SEC put forward for digital assets was an asset “that is issued and/or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology” and included other commonly used terms such as “virtual currencies,” “coins” and “tokens.”

The SEC said in its August proposal that currently, information regarding a fund’s digital assets is reported in an “other” category, which results in “less robust Form PF data for analysis.”

It proposed the definition in order to obtain separate, and, by extension, more accurate reporting on such assets.

“We believe it is important to collect information on funds’ exposures to digital assets in order to understand better their overall market exposures.”

However, the latest updates to the SEC’s Form PF rules now require — among other things — that SEC-registered funds report the occurrence of key events that could indicate systemic risk or harm to investors in a likely response to the U.S. banking crisis.

Related: SEC’s war on crypto: How far will it go?

Firms must also disclose details of their fees and expenses as the SEC tries to cast a light on the multi-trillion dollar sector.

The SEC hasn’t always shied away from crypto-related definitions, announcing in mid-April that it would revisit its definition of an “exchange” to possibly include decentralized finance (DeFi).

SEC Chair Gary Gensler has also long been vocal in claiming that cryptocurrencies are securities under his commission’s remit and that the U.S. crypto sector is acting afoul of securities laws.

Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT have become the latest way for “bad actors” to distribute malware, scams and spam, research from Meta’s security team warns.

A May 1 research report from Facebook parent Meta’s security team found 10 malware families posing as ChatGPT and similar artificial intelligence tools in March, some of which were found in various browser extensions, noting: 

“Since March alone, our security analysts have found around 10 malware families posing as ChatGPT and similar tools to compromise accounts across the internet.”

Meta explained that these “bad actors” — malware operators, scammers, spammers and the like — have moved to AI because it’s the “latest wave” of what is capturing “people’s imagination and excitement.”

The research comes amid a major interest in artificial intelligence, with ChatGPT, in particular, capturing much attention brought to AI. 

“For example, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-related tools,” it added.

Meta security said that some of these “malicious extensions” included operations with ChatGPT functionality which coexisted alongside the malware.

The firm’s security team then explained that bad actors tend to move to where the latest craze is, referencing the hype around digital currency and the scams that have come from it:

“This is not unique to the generative AI space. As an industry, we’ve seen this across other topics popular in their time, such as crypto scams fueled by the interest in digital currency.”

“The generative AI space is rapidly evolving, and bad actors know it,” they added, stressing the need to be vigilant.

Guy Rosen, Meta’s chief security officer, went one step further in a recent interview with Reuters, stating that “ChatGPT is the new crypto” for these bad actors.

It should, however, be noted that Meta is now making its own developments in generative AI.

Meta AI is currently building various forms of AI to help improve its augmented and artificial reality technologies.

Despite being heavily invested in the Metaverse, AI is now Meta’s single largest investment, according to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.

Cointelegraph contacted OpenAI — the team behind ChatGPT — for comment.

More than a third of the top 1,000 crypto projects — a term that includes both crypto companies and individual tokens — haven’t published a single new article on their respective websites in 2023.

According to a May 1 research report from blockchain marketing agency Guerilla Buzz — whose clients include the likes of CoinGecko and crypto exchange AAX — a staggering 35.8% of the top 1,000 cryptocurrency projects have failed to update their websites with any new written content this year.

Additionally, the report found that of these 1,000 projects, less than half (49.7%) had posted more than two new articles so far in 2023.

Guerilla Buzz researchers stated that the inspiration for the comparative study emerged after noticing that “many crypto companies do not prioritize strong marketing foundations.” Instead, the bulk of these companies choose to focus their efforts on “generating hype for their token sales” and “opting for short-lived growth spurts” instead of prioritizing long-term organic growth.

The paper claims that the research methodology was “straightforward” yet “labor-intensive.” First, researchers manually inspected the corresponding website of the top 1,00 crypto projects to see if they had a blog. From there, they assessed the number of articles published within recent years and checked to see how many new blog posts had been published in 2023.

Of the top 10 crypto projects, Binance’s BNB Chain was the clear blogging leader, with 59 new articles published this year. In second place was Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8793

, with 36 new posts, followed by Cardano 

ADA

$0.365

, with 12.

The paper also found that the most popular blogging website of choice for crypto projects was the free blog hosting website Medium. This is reportedly a practice that has stuck around since the days of the 2017 initial coin offering craze, where thousands of new projects popped up in the span of a few months, many of which opted for little more than a one-page website, a white paper and “lofty promises of a tech revolution.”

Related: This blockchain-based social media platform is going after TikTok

Notably, while Medium remains the go-to platform for many crypto project blogs, it may not actually be the best choice for companies seeking long-term growth.

“By relying on Medium’s platform, these companies are essentially boosting Medium’s traffic and growth instead of their own,” researchers wrote.

“While Medium’s excellent on-page SEO capabilities and high domain authority may have made it an easy choice for crypto companies seeking to generate buzz quickly, this focus on short-term gains may not be sustainable in the long run.”

Cryptocurrency exchange FTX is seeking to recover around $4 billion from similarly bankrupt crypto lender Genesis and a still-solvent British Virgin Islands-based entity — part of efforts to recover value for creditors.

In a May 3 court filing in a New York Bankruptcy Court, lawyers for FTX sought $1.8 billion in loans and a $273 million collateral pledge allegedly given to Genesis from FTX’s sister trading firm Alameda Research.

FTX is also seeking to claw back $1.6 billion in withdrawals allegedly made by Genesis and a further $213 million purported to be withdrawn by its BVI-based entity GGC International from the exchange before it collapsed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11.

The filing claims Genesis was “largely repaid” its nearly $8 billion in loans made to Alameda, “unlike other FTX creditors and customers.”

FTX alleged the bankrupt lender was “one of the main feeder funds for FTX and instrumental to its fraudulent business model.”

The exchange’s lawyers are seeking the clawback under bankruptcy laws that allow it to recoup “avoidable transfers” that occur in a 90-day period before a company declares bankruptcy.

Previous clawbacks by FTX have focused on $3.2 billion in payments made to its former executives, a $460 million investment made by Alameda into venture capital firm Modulo Capital and around $93 million in political donations made by founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former top brass.

The former OpenSea manager who was accused of insider trading of NFTs has been convicted on May 3 of wire fraud and money laundering in a New York federal court, according to Reuters.

According to prosecutors, Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at OpenSea, was in charge of choosing which NFTs would be featured on the website’s nonfungible token marketplace.

After making these decisions, he frequently purchased these NFTs and then resold them after they had been featured, prosecutors said. He was charged with wire fraud and money laundering on June 1 in connection with these alleged transactions.

The trial began on April 24 and has been watched closely by lawyers specializing in crypto-related issues. Some legal experts have argued that the outcome of the case may affect whether NFTs are considered securities.

According to the May 3 report, defense attorney Daniel Filor argued in the trial’s closing statements that Chastain wasn’t guilty because he had never been told the information was supposed to be confidential, stating “Nobody told Nate that he couldn't use or share that information.""

By contrast, prosecuting attorney Allison Nichols argued that Chastain knew he was breaking the law. She claimed that he used anonymous OpenSea accounts to make the trades, implying that he was afraid of being caught.

“He hid what he was doing,” Nichols reportedly told the jury in her rebuttal. “He knew that he had violated OpenSea’s confidentiality agreement.”

It marks the first time a person has been slapped for using privileged knowledge to trade nonfungible tokens.

A former employee of Coinbase, Ishan Wahi, and his brother Nikhil were also charged with insider trading of cryptocurrencies in a separate case in July. In that case, Nikhil Wahi pleaded guilty on September 12.

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says we may have AGI ‘in the next few years’

The CEO of Google DeepMind says human-level AI could emerge before 2033 — an event that could radically alter how crypto trading bots and GPT-based tech functions.

Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, recently predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) systems would reach human-level cognition somewhere between “the next few years” and “maybe within a decade.” 

Advertisement

Hassabis, who got his start in the gaming industry, co-founded Google DeepMind (formerly DeepMind Technologies), the company known for developing the AlphaGo AI system responsible for beating the world’s top human Go players.

In a recent interview conducted during The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything festival, Hassabis told interviewer Chris Mims he believes the arrival of machines with human-level cognition is imminent:

“The progress in the last few years has been pretty incredible. I don’t see any reason why that progress is going to slow down. I think it may even accelerate. So I think we could be just a few years, maybe within a decade away.”

These comments come just two weeks after internal restructuring led Google to announce the merging of “Google AI” and “DeepMind” into the aptly named “Google DeepMind.”

When asked to define “AGI” — artificial general intelligence — Hassabis responded: “human-level cognition.”

There currently exists no standardized definition, test or benchmark for AGI widely accepted by the science, technology, engineering and math community. Nor is there a unified scientific consensus on whether AGI is even possible.

Some notable figures such as Roger Penrose (Stephen Hawking’s long-time research partner) believe AGI can’t be achieved, while others think it could take decades or centuries for scientists and engineers to figure it out.

Among those who are bullish on AGI in the near term, or some similar form of human-level AI, are Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

AGI’s become a hot topic in the wake of the launch of ChatGPT and myriad similar AI products and services over the past few months. Often cited as a “holy grail” technology, experts predict human-level AI will disrupt every facet of life on Earth.

If human-level AI is ever achieved, it could disrupt various aspects of the crypto industry. In the cryptocurrency world, users could see fully autonomous machines capable of acting as entrepreneurs, C-suite executives, advisers and traders, with the intellectual reasoning capacity of a human and the ability to retain information and execute code like a computer system.

As to whether AGI agents would serve humankind as AI-powered tools or compete with humans for resources remains to be seen.

For his part, Hassabis didn't speculate on any scenarios, but he did tell The Wall Street Journal that he “would advocate developing these types of AGI technologies in a cautious manner using the scientific method, where you try and do very careful controlled experiments to understand what the underlying system does.”

This might stand in juxtaposition to the current landscape, where products such as his own employer's Google Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT were recently made available for public use.

Related: ‘Godfather of AI’ resigns from Google, warns of the dangers of AI

Industry insiders such as OpenAI's Altman and DeepMind’s Nando de Freitas have stated that they believe AGI could emerge by itself if developers continue to scale current models. And one Google researcher recently parted ways with the company after claiming that a model named LaMDA had already become sentient.

Because of the uncertainty surrounding the development of these technologies and their potential impact on humankind, thousands of people, including Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, recently signed an open letter asking companies and individuals building related systems to pause development for six months so scientists can assess the potential for harm.

The Texas State Securities Board joined several state regulators in issuing cease-and-desist orders against Horatiu Charlie Caragaceanu and his organizations, The Shark of Wall Street and Hedge4.ai, for promoting two cryptocurrencies named TruthGPT Coin and Elon Musk AI Token. The orders seek to clamp down on what they claim is a fraudulent securities scheme attempting to capitalize on the growing buzz around artificial intelligence (AI).

The TruthGPT Coin is being marketed as a cryptocurrency that utilizes an AI system called Elon Musk AI. The AI model can allegedly examine multiple digital assets, anticipate future cryptocurrency values and distinguish lucrative investments from fraudulent ones. The parties involved are also promoting TruthGPT Coin as a highly profitable venture, even stating it could increase in worth by a staggering 10,000 times.

The Emergency Cease and Desist Order states that investors are being falsely informed of Elon Musk's endorsement of TruthGPT Coin, and animated avatars and images of Musk are being utilized to give the impression of his support. Promotional media also shows the alleged involvement of other public figures, including Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, and Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. 

Securities Commissioner Travis Iles cautioned, ""Bad actors continue their attempts to capitalize on this widespread public interest."" He explained: 

""They’re devising schemes that create the appearance that they have developed sophisticated artificial intelligence platforms — but instead of being rooted in artificial intelligence, the offerings too often are nothing more than frauds.”

Texas State Securities Board Enforcement Director Joe Rotunda advised investors to stay vigilant and “to set aside emotion and objectively evaluate every offering — especially when pitched by an unknown person through the internet.”

The fraudulent scheme highlights the continuous need for caution and due diligence in the cryptocurrency industry. Using buzzwords like ""artificial intelligence"" can be enticing for investors, but it can also be used by bad actors to promote fraudulent activities like pump-and-dump schemes, which is common within the crypto industry.

According to data gathered by Chainalysis, “Of the 40,521 tokens launched in 2022 that gained sufficient traction to be worth analyzing, 9,902, or 24%, saw a price decline in the first week indicative of possible pump and dump activity.”

Securities token platform INX has launched a wallet with compliance features for institutions, according to a May 3 announcement. The new wallet was created in partnership with wallet infrastructure provider BitGo and uses multi-party computation (MPC) technology.

INX securities tokens exist on the Ethereum network and follow the ERC-1404 token standard. The standard was created in 2018 to allow for compliance-friendly Ethereum tokens. These tokens can only be transferred between users that have passed identity verification with a participating institution.

The new wallet allows institutions to comply with cybersecurity and custody standards in the financial industry when holding INX securities tokens. No single person is given access to the private key that controls a given account. Instead, the key is split into three or more “shards” that have to be combined to sign transactions, which is part of the MPC technology.

According to the announcement, the wallet also contains features to make employee access privileges easier to manage. Companies can task different employees with different roles, such as “viewers, spenders, approvers and administrators.” They can also segregate clients’ assets by splitting up funds into multiple wallets and giving “approver” privileges to each individual client. This allows institutions to give their clients more control over their individual accounts, the announcement said.

Lisa Jowett, head of platform sales at BitGo, said she thinks these new features will help make institutional investors more comfortable using Web3 technology:

“Our wallets can connect to and interact seamlessly with [the INX platform] without compromising on security or reliability. This will unlock new possibilities for investors and serve as a gateway for institutional adoption of Web3.”

INX reached a major milestone on April 3 when it launched its first equity token from a public company, Greenbriar Capital. INX advisor Douglas Borthwick has argued that eventually “all assets will migrate to the blockchain.”

The company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer within the United States. Some industry experts have argued that the U.S. doesn’t have clear enough crypto regulations to allow most crypto exchanges to gain this designation.

Alex Mashinsky, co-founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius Network, has filed a response to New York Attorney General Letitia James’ suit against him. According to the document, the suit has shortcomings in presenting the facts in the case and its legal argument and should be dismissed.

James claims in her suit on behalf of the people of New York state that Mashinsky defrauded over 26,000 New York residents out of billions of dollars, particularly by making false statements about the company’s financial situation.

Mashinsky’s response alleges the suit “parrots misinformation,” shows a lack of understanding of Celsius’ business and cherry-picks statements from Mashinsky’s 180 weekly YouTube appearances. In addition, the suit allegedly does not consider circumstances beyond Mashinsky’s control — that is, the crypto market downturn.

The response also faults the suit’s application of the Martin Act, New York’s strict “blue sky” securities law and other statutes cited in the case's seven counts. The response states:

“Because the Complaint fails to state a legally-cognizable claim against Mashinsky and is otherwise deficient, it should be dismissed in its entirety.”

James’ suit against Mashinsky was announced Jan. 5 and amended in March. Notably, at least for Mashinsky’s response, the suit does not name Celsius as a defendant, only Mashinsky.

Celsius declared bankruptcy on July  13, 2022 after pausing withdrawals a month prior. Depositors still have not received their money back, although Celsius settled with decentralized finance market makers Compound, Aave and Maker on the eve of its bankruptcy filing.

A court-appointed independent examiner found many issues with the company’s behavior in a report issued in January. Examiner Shoba Pillay said the company paid $1.36 billion more in rewards than it generated in revenue from customer assets between 2018 and June 30, 2022.

An auction of Celsius assets is scheduled for May 3, after a number of delays. Bidders reportedly include Gemini and Coinbase.

On May 3, layer-1 blockchain Fuse announced that it would pledge $10 million to “reinvigorate the Fuse ecosystem and drive growth in multiple areas.” The program, dubbed “Fuse Ignite,” is structured between liquid incentives and grants. As told by developers:

“Teams can apply for grants of between $5,000 and $25,000, depending on the focus of their project or service. DeFi projects can apply for incentives designed to boost liquidity and general user activity when deploying on Fuse Network.”

Upon application approval, Fuse Ignite operator grants are issued in Fuse Tokens (FUSE) and USD Coin 

USDC

$1.00

. Operators use the Fuse Network blockchain and other tools to power payment services. 

Parts of the $10-million budget are also allocated for adoption incentives and community airdrops. To participate, users must hold and stake a minimum balance of Fuse, provide liquidity for supported projects, bridge assets and transact regularly. The launch of Fuse Ignite also coincides with the upcoming deployment of a launchpad on Voltage Finance that aims to be the preferred solution for new tokens looking to join the Fuse ecosystem.

Fuse reached a peak market capitalization of nearly $300 million last year, with its total value locked growing to $40 million. Since its inception in 2019, the project claims to have facilitated over 120 million transactions across 1.35 million wallets, with over 100 Web3 projects building on its current ecosystem. In September 2022, Fuse partnered with ChromePay to bring decentralized identifiers to Africa. Fuse has also awarded ChromePay a grant for an undisclosed amount to build out its decentralized finance and decentralized ID services directly on the blockchain.

Hollywood studios reject banning AI from writer’s rooms

Artificial intelligence (AI) brings yet another industry into a hot debate over its usage as Hollywood and the greater media industry faces petitions from the Writers Guild of America (WGA).

The WGA recently sent out a list of demands that included the regulation of AI usage on the minimum basic agreement (MBA) covered projects. It stated that AI should not be used to write or rewrite literary material nor be used as source material.

Additionally, it demanded that MBA-covered material can’t be used in training AI. In its initial statement back in March, the guild wrote:

“The WGA’s proposal to regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies ensures the Companies can’t use AI to undermine writers’ working standards including compensation, residuals, separated rights and credits.”

However, Hollywood studios have officially rejected the demands and countered with an offer of “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”

This issue pertaining to AI usage was one of many, including compensation and working conditions, that pushed the WGA to go on an authorized strike in Los Angeles on May 2 for the first time in 15 years.

— Writers Guild of America, East (@WGAEast) May 3, 2023

Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator for the WGA, called the proposal “reasonable” and said that AI should be kept “out of the business of writing television and movies.” She also commented that some members of the guild had penned the name “plagiarism machine” for AI.

AI tools are already being implemented in Hollywood for touching up visuals and de-aging actors’ appearances, among other things. 

Hollywood production studios’ stance of openness to emerging technologies, such as AI, differs from the stance of major companies in other creative industries like the music industry.

The initial response of Universal Music Group after AI-generated music started popping up on streaming services was a manhunt to get them removed, along with lawsuits. Though some artists themselves with established names in the industry are encouraging the usage of the technology.

Crypto.com announced “Amy” on May 2. The crypto exchange’s new AI companion is built to inform users about the industry, including real-time token prices and projects, historical events, and more. According to the announcement, Amy, which uses ChatGPT as its base, is currently in the pilot phase to “gather learnings” before future expansion.

Abhi Bisarya, the executive vice president of product at Crypto.com, says the company is “bullish” on the usage of AI in crypto.

“As with other businesses and sectors, we see incredible potential and opportunity in the convergence of AI with the crypto industry and our platform specifically.”

A Crypto.com spokesperson told Cointelegraph that although these are the “early days” of generative AI, there is potential for “massive positive implications” for many industries if done responsibly.

“This is particularly the case for crypto when it comes to helping educate users about the underlying technology and financial services more broadly.“

As for drawbacks, the spokesperson said they expect a lot of feedback from this AI pilot, which will be “integrated into future upgrades.“

The Web3 infrastructure company Solana Labs announced its own ChatGPT-based plugin on April 26, which uses AI to fetch blockchain data to check wallet balances, transfer tokens and purchase nonfungible tokens.

Binance also launched an AI chatbot. Like Crypto.com, the Binance chatbot emphasizes user education as part of its Web3 academy.

The cryptocurrency exchange and digital asset trading platform Bitget recently pledged $10 million toward developing the Fetch.ai ecosystem by “providing consultations on marketing” and other services to help Fetch expand its business network.

The lawyers and consulting firms assisting cryptocurrency exchange FTX through its bankruptcy proceedings are set to cash in a total of $103 million over the first quarter.

March saw five firms — Sullivan & Cromwell, Alvarez & Marshal, AlixPartners, Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb — bill FTX a combined $36.4 million, according to several court filings between April 28 and May 2.

The invoices from March were slightly higher than January and February’s figures of $34.2 million and $32.5 million, respectively.

New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell again walked away with the biggest paycheck, billing $14.1 million in fees and expenses for March, adding to a total of $44.4 million over the first quarter.

Partners at the firm took home $2,165 per hour while paralegals and legal analysts were paid $425 and $595 per hour for their contributions.

Consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal came in next, invoicing over $13.8 million in March for the tens of thousands of hours it collectively committed to avoidance actions, financial analysis and accounting procedures.

It was the third successive billing of over $10 million for the firm, which has served as FTX’s restructuring advisor since Sam Bankman-Fried’s former empire filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11.

Fellow law firms Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb respectively billed FTX $3.19 million and $644,000 in March for respective totals of $7.3 million and $1.9 million over the first quarter.

As Landis Rath & Cobb serve as FTX’s special counsel, the firm has spent most of its hours in the courtroom attending court hearings and undergoing litigation procedures.

Over 180 lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell, Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and Landis Rath & Cobb have been assigned to work on the FTX case.

Forensics consulting firm AlixPartners invoiced its largest bill at $4.51 million in March, totaling $10.2 million over the quarter, for the firm’s work in analyzing decentralized finance products and tokens in FTX’s possession.

Despite a severely troubled six months, FTX hasn’t put the nail in the coffin yet.

With $7.3 billion in assets recovered FTX’s legal team is eyeing a potential reboot of the trading platform as early as April 2024.

Human rights advocacy group Amnesty International has retracted images generated by artificial intelligence that it used in a campaign to publicize police brutality in Colombia during national protests in 2021.

The group was criticized for using AI to produce the images for its social media accounts, according to reports. One image, in particular, was highlighted by The Guardian on May 2.

It depicts a woman being dragged away by police during Colombia’s protests against deep and long-standing economic and social inequalities in 2021.

However, a closer look shows a few discrepancies in the image, such as the uncanny-looking faces, dated police uniforms and a protestor who appears to be somehow wrapped in a flag that is not the correct flag of Colombia.

The bottom of each image also carries a disclaimer saying the images are produced by an AI.

Amnesty International told The Guardian it chose to use AI to generate images to protect protesters from possible state retribution. Erika Guevara Rosas, director for Americas at Amnesty, said:

“We have removed the images from social media posts, as we don’t want the criticism for the use of AI-generated images to distract from the core message in support of the victims and their calls for justice in Colombia,”

Photojournalists criticized the use of the images, commenting that in today’s highly polarized era of fake news, people are more likely to question the media's credibility.

Media scholar Roland Meyer commented on the deleted images, stating, “Image synthesis reproduces and reinforces visual stereotypes almost by default.” Meyer added that they were “ultimately nothing more than propaganda.”

Other images, now deleted by Amnesty, were shared by Twitter users in late April.

AI is being increasingly used to generate images and visual media. In late April, HustleGPT founder Dave Craige posted a video of the United States Republican Party using AI imagery in its political campaign.

“We all knew that AI and deep-fake images were going to make it to politics, I just didn’t realize it would happen so quickly,” he exclaimed.

Cointelegraph contacted Amnesty for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Defunct crypto lender Celsius Network is looking to combine its United Kingdom and United States entities as new court filings allege that any supposed distinction between the two companies was a “sham.”

The central point of dispute is focused on a decision made by the crypto lender in June 2021, when Celsius Network Limited (CNL) was issued with a warning to cease operations in the U.K. from the country’s Financial Conduct Authority.

To avoid fallout, CNL set up a Limited Liability Company — Celsius Network LLC — in the state of Delaware and looked to transfer its assets to the new company.

According to a May 1 court filing from the now-bankrupt crypto firm, the migration of the two entities “resulted in intercompany chaos.” The filing adds that formal documentation of the intercompany relationship was “not completed for several months” and when it was “it remained ambiguous” what transactions the agreements affected.

The filing claims that for everyday investors, the result of this transfer was too confusing to make sense of; however, the more “sophisticated” Series B investors were well aware of the implications of such dubious recordkeeping.

As a result, the two entities should be treated as one and the same in subsequent bankruptcy proceedings, so that smaller creditors are not ignored in favor of Series B investors when it comes to the recovery and return of lost funds.

According to a corresponding court filing from the Celsius Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (UCC), the migration was a “sham” and the transactions that facilitated the transfer of billions of dollars worth of assets between the two were likely fraudulent.

 as a result of the Celsius collapse, summarised the UCC filing in a series of tweets on May 2, saying that “Celsius acted as if the migration never occurred” and was given “poor documentation” and “no clear distinctions” to distinguish between the two entities.

In a March 9 memorandum opinion, Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn found that customers only had claims against Celsius’ Delaware-based LLC, meaning that Series B investors stand to be more likely to receive recompensation.

The auction of the remaining Celsius assets is scheduled to go ahead on Wednesday, May 3, with a number of major firms including the exchanges Coinbase and Gemini vying for possession of the defunct firms’ assets.

NovaWulf Digital Management currently stands as the “stalking horse bidder,” a term used to describe the first mover that sets the bar for the ensuing bids. NovaWulf’s proposal includes a direct cash contribution in the range of $45 million to $55 million. If NovaWulf’s proposal is accepted, customers can expect to recover up to 70% of their funds.

The auction marks a significant step forward for Celsius’ customers in recovering their funds, after the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 14, 2022.
